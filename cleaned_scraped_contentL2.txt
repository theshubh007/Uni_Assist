Why I chose SJSU
"Enrolling at  has changed my life. Not only have I been able to reach a
                                       lifelong personal goal, I have also become the first in my family to graduate from
                                       college. My experience at SJSU has also prepared me with the knowledge, skills, and
                                       confidence to enroll in a masters degree program at Harvard University."
Lucia Sanchez'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"My program has helped me expand my knowledge and learn how I can problem solve for
                                       life. I am confident that I will be able to apply what I have learned towards my future
                                       goals of working in government intelligence and earning a graduate degree."
Elisha Hall'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"I needed a quality, flexible degree option to fit my life and I'm so glad that I chose
                                        - it was the best decision I made this year!"
Aline Shirvani'25 Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"I was not going to be able to do college if I had to be on campus. Being a mom and
                                       working full-time is really hard. However, I had a really good support system within
                                        to help me achieve my goals."
Yhizel Torres'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"'s class flexibility and format fits really well with my life and availability.
                                       My academic advisor is also great. They make me confident that I will be set up for
                                       success and have a stress free experience when it comes to enrolling in all of my
                                       necessary courses."
Jimmy Ancheta-Tilley'24 Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"I'm so glad that I found this program. It has been the best experience from the very
                                       beginning. My admissions counselor kept in contact with me every step of the way and
                                       the new student orientation was so welcoming."
Chelsea Franey'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"A highlight for me was the camaraderie that I found with other fellow students. I
                                       didn't think that was possible because it was an online program, but the relationships
                                       and friendships that I was able to build I think are lifelong."
Sandra Ukili'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The online Discord student community was an invaluable resource for me to share information
                                       and study with my classmates."
Jay Jolin'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU
"This program highlights how important educational advisors are. They really are the
                                       driving force. They encouraged us, they motivated us, and they were there every step
                                       of the way."
Llarelie Jimenez'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"I really enjoy teaching children, and this program is enabling me to professionally
                                       study material that I can go into the field and use to be the best teacher I can be
                                       for my students."
Chris Padua'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The Anthropology program is giving me a chance to bring my vision to life and organize
                                       myself in a way in which I can be productive online. We are taught in so many unique
                                       and variable ways so no matter your learning style there is something for you."
Ashley Bergstrom'24, Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"Completing my program was something that I wanted to prove to myself that I could
                                       do. Now, I think that I am able to better present my work and have better analysis
                                       skills to combine with my other life experiences."
Jaime Abonce'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU

                                       me to believe that I can make a difference in the community. That's why I'm proud
                                       to be an  student."
Violeta Bjorngjeld'23 Educational and Community Leadership

Aline Shirvani'25 Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"I was not going to be able to do college if I had to be on campus. Being a mom and
                                       working full-time is really hard. However, I had a really good support system within
                                        to help me achieve my goals."
Yhizel Torres'23 Educational and Community Leadership

"'s class flexibility and format fits really well with my life and availability.
                                       My academic advisor is also great. They make me confident that I will be set up for
                                       success and have a stress free experience when it comes to enrolling in all of my

Jimmy Ancheta-Tilley'24 Anthropology

"I'm so glad that I found this program. It has been the best experience from the very
                                       beginning. My admissions counselor kept in contact with me every step of the way and
                                       the new student orientation was so welcoming."
Chelsea Franey'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"A highlight for me was the camaraderie that I found with other fellow students. I
                                       didn't think that was possible because it was an online program, but the relationships
                                       and friendships that I was able to build I think are lifelong."
Sandra Ukili'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The online Discord student community was an invaluable resource for me to share information
                                       and study with my classmates."
Jay Jolin'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU
"This program highlights how important educational advisors are. They really are the
                                       driving force. They encouraged us, they motivated us, and they were there every step
                                       of the way."
Llarelie Jimenez'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"I really enjoy teaching children, and this program is enabling me to professionally
                                       study material that I can go into the field and use to be the best teacher I can be
                                       for my students."
Chris Padua'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The Anthropology program is giving me a chance to bring my vision to life and organize
                                       myself in a way in which I can be productive online. We are taught in so many unique
                                       and variable ways so no matter your learning style there is something for you."
Ashley Bergstrom'24, Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"Completing my program was something that I wanted to prove to myself that I could
                                       do. Now, I think that I am able to better present my work and have better analysis
                                       skills to combine with my other life experiences."
Jaime Abonce'24 Information Science and Data Analytics

                                       to be an  student."
Violeta Bjorngjeld'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"I am a team-oriented person. My classmates and I have helped each other out for the
                                       past few semesters and it's been exactly what I've needed."

Why I chose SJSU
"Enrolling at  has changed my life. Not only have I been able to reach a
                                       lifelong personal goal, I have also become the first in my family to graduate from
                                       college. My experience at SJSU has also prepared me with the knowledge, skills, and
                                       confidence to enroll in a masters degree program at Harvard University."
Lucia Sanchez'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"My program has helped me expand my knowledge and learn how I can problem solve for
                                       life. I am confident that I will be able to apply what I have learned towards my future
                                       goals of working in government intelligence and earning a graduate degree."
Elisha Hall'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"I needed a quality, flexible degree option to fit my life and I'm so glad that I chose
                                        - it was the best decision I made this year!"
Aline Shirvani'25 Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"I was not going to be able to do college if I had to be on campus. Being a mom and
                                       working full-time is really hard. However, I had a really good support system within
                                        to help me achieve my goals."
Yhizel Torres'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"'s class flexibility and format fits really well with my life and availability.
                                       My academic advisor is also great. They make me confident that I will be set up for
                                       success and have a stress free experience when it comes to enrolling in all of my
                                       necessary courses."
Jimmy Ancheta-Tilley'24 Anthropology

"I'm so glad that I found this program. It has been the best experience from the very
                                       beginning. My admissions counselor kept in contact with me every step of the way and
                                       the new student orientation was so welcoming."
Chelsea Franey'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"A highlight for me was the camaraderie that I found with other fellow students. I
                                       didn't think that was possible because it was an online program, but the relationships
                                       and friendships that I was able to build I think are lifelong."
Sandra Ukili'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The online Discord student community was an invaluable resource for me to share information
                                       and study with my classmates."
Jay Jolin'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU
"This program highlights how important educational advisors are. They really are the
                                       driving force. They encouraged us, they motivated us, and they were there every step
                                       of the way."
Llarelie Jimenez'23 Educational and Community Leadership

"I really enjoy teaching children, and this program is enabling me to professionally
                                       study material that I can go into the field and use to be the best teacher I can be
                                       for my students."
Chris Padua'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The Anthropology program is giving me a chance to bring my vision to life and organize
                                       myself in a way in which I can be productive online. We are taught in so many unique
                                       and variable ways so no matter your learning style there is something for you."
Ashley Bergstrom'24, Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"Completing my program was something that I wanted to prove to myself that I could
                                       do. Now, I think that I am able to better present my work and have better analysis
                                       skills to combine with my other life experiences."
Jaime Abonce'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU

                                       me to believe that I can make a difference in the community. That's why I'm proud
                                       to be an  student."
Violeta Bjorngjeld'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"I am a team-oriented person. My classmates and I have helped each other out for the
                                       past few semesters and it's been exactly what I've needed."

Why I chose SJSU
"Enrolling at  has changed my life. Not only have I been able to reach a
                                       lifelong personal goal, I have also become the first in my family to graduate from
                                       college. My experience at SJSU has also prepared me with the knowledge, skills, and
                                       confidence to enroll in a masters degree program at Harvard University."
Lucia Sanchez'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"My program has helped me expand my knowledge and learn how I can problem solve for
                                       life. I am confident that I will be able to apply what I have learned towards my future
                                       goals of working in government intelligence and earning a graduate degree."
Elisha Hall'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"I needed a quality, flexible degree option to fit my life and I'm so glad that I chose
                                        - it was the best decision I made this year!"
Aline Shirvani'25 Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"I was not going to be able to do college if I had to be on campus. Being a mom and
                                       working full-time is really hard. However, I had a really good support system within
                                        to help me achieve my goals."
Yhizel Torres'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"'s class flexibility and format fits really well with my life and availability.
                                       My academic advisor is also great. They make me confident that I will be set up for
                                       success and have a stress free experience when it comes to enrolling in all of my
                                       necessary courses."
Jimmy Ancheta-Tilley'24 Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"I'm so glad that I found this program. It has been the best experience from the very
                                       beginning. My admissions counselor kept in contact with me every step of the way and
                                       the new student orientation was so welcoming."
Chelsea Franey'24 Economics
Why I chose SJSU
"A highlight for me was the camaraderie that I found with other fellow students. I
                                       didn't think that was possible because it was an online program, but the relationships
                                       and friendships that I was able to build I think are lifelong."
Sandra Ukili'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The online Discord student community was an invaluable resource for me to share information
                                       and study with my classmates."
Jay Jolin'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU
"This program highlights how important educational advisors are. They really are the
                                       driving force. They encouraged us, they motivated us, and they were there every step
                                       of the way."
Llarelie Jimenez'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"I really enjoy teaching children, and this program is enabling me to professionally
                                       study material that I can go into the field and use to be the best teacher I can be
                                       for my students."
Chris Padua'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"The Anthropology program is giving me a chance to bring my vision to life and organize
                                       myself in a way in which I can be productive online. We are taught in so many unique
                                       and variable ways so no matter your learning style there is something for you."
Ashley Bergstrom'24, Anthropology
Why I chose SJSU
"Completing my program was something that I wanted to prove to myself that I could
                                       do. Now, I think that I am able to better present my work and have better analysis
                                       skills to combine with my other life experiences."
Jaime Abonce'24 Information Science and Data Analytics
Why I chose SJSU

                                       me to believe that I can make a difference in the community. That's why I'm proud
                                       to be an  student."
Violeta Bjorngjeld'23 Educational and Community Leadership
Why I chose SJSU
"I am a team-oriented person. My classmates and I have helped each other out for the
                                       past few semesters and it's been exactly what I've needed."

Pay Your Tuition and Fees
SJSU's Bursar's Office assists students with paying tuition and fees.
Fees are Subject to Change
The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published
                                 schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate.
                                 Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after initial fee payments are made, to
                                 increase or modify any listed fees, without notice, until the date when instruction
                                 for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded
                                 as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees, the
                                 Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees
                                 will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee
                                 Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 - 66028.6 of the Education Code).

                                 '25 Psychology
When I was a freshman, CAPISE was not established, and I felt very isolated and alone
                                 in my experience. CAPISE gave me a place to explore not only my cultural identity,
                                 but how my other identities inform and influence my experiences and time here at San
                                 Jose State. I feel more connected to myself, my peers, and my community.

                                 '25 Public Health
Student Affairs does a great job of empowering students to be innovators and create
                                 your own path to success. And I think that the Student Affairs' Student Involvement
                                 department is the #1 resource for students on campus.
                                 Hannah Bittar
                                 '23 Biology
One of the best decisions I made while being a student at SJSU is making the decision
                                 to be a Peer Educator for 3 years. I took on different roles to support and guide
                                 my fellow students. As an S.I. Leader for the first 2 years, I facilitated group tutoring
                                 sessions in Biology and Chemistry. These interactive sessions allowed my peers to
                                 grasp high-yield topics and enhance their academic success, which was very rewarding
                                 for me to witness. Thank you to Student Affairs and the Peer Connections team!

Commencement
Commencement is an honored tradition atall universities. At SJSU's spring and fall
                                    ceremonies, there's special element: the ceremonial mace. An ornamental staff or scepter,
                                    the mace is carried by officials as part of formal parliamentary or academic ceremonies.
                                    A gift from the Tower Foundation of SJSU, the universitys ceremonial mace was designed
                                    and created this spring by Art and Art History Lecturer Yvonne Escalante, 13 MFA
                                    Spatial Arts. She found inspiration for the design in both SJSU history and the paths
                                    students take to reach graduation.

                                    Together, we provide a web of support for all SJSU innovators.
Support SJSU Innovation
SpartUp Incubator Takes Flight
On September 22, San Jos State University launched SpartUp Incubator, an interdisciplinary
                                    program that supports nascent businesses created by SJSU students, alumni, faculty
                                    and staff, in front of an estimated 200 students and prospective partners at SJSUs
                                    Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library.
SpartUp Incubator
The SpartUp Incubator Program provides a unique experiential environment for Spartan
                                 entrepreneurs (students, faculty, staff and alumni) to learn and practice real-world
                                 entrepreneurial skills that position them to succeed as startup founders and principals,
                                 employees, and commercializing researchers.
Intellectual Property Notification
Online Intellectual Property Notification Forms are provided to initiate the disclosure
                                 process. The Office of Innovation will work with the lead investigator to use information
                                 from the online Notification to prepare a complete Disclosure.
Full Intellectual Property Disclosure
If you are familiar with the disclosure process, you may elect to bypass the notification
                                 step and start the process by preparing a draft full disclosure. The Office of Innovation
                                 will work with the creators to prepare a complete Disclosure.
Sponsor Student Projects
SJSU students represent the next generation of creative and technical minds. They
                                 are resources to explore the relationship between science, engineering, technology,
                                 and the humanities. Our Industry-Sponsored Student Projects provide industry the opportunity
                                 to access this unique resource.

SJSU: Discover What it Means to Be Transformative
At San Jos State, transformation is defined by our community. Our students trajectory
                                 is upward, regardless of where they start. They have the opportunity to graduate with
                                 increased future earnings and less than half the average student debt of their California
                                 counterparts. And they go on to work in some of the worlds most influential companies.
                                 As alumni of SJSU, they join our faculty and staff in positively impacting Silicon
                                 Valley, the Bay Area and beyond. We are SJSU  transformation defined.

Testimonials of Transformation
Cornelio (CJ) Balmaceda
20 Justice Studies
I was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to SJSU. But the
                                 moment I stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. One of the best ways
                                 SJSU transformed my life was by being introduced to lifelong friends and developing
                                 many connections. I will forever cherish my days at SJSU, and because I attended there,
                                 I am a better individual. Thank you SJSU!
Tara Caughlan
16 MA Environmental Studies
I met so many amazing students and staff at SJSU. In the environmental studies program,
                                 I was surrounded by people who wanted to make the world a better place. I now work
                                 at the San Francisco Zoo, which is dedicated to conservation, both local and distant.
                                 My studies at SJSU helped me see the plight of animals in a much larger context. Thank
                                 you, SJSU!
Tommy Wen Chin
22 Physics
[My SJSU professor] gave me the courage that I had been longing for to pursue physics.
                                 Every day since then, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to pursue what
                                 I truly love.
Laurel Eby
10 MA Library and Information Science
I was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years when I decided to go back to school to get
                                 a master's degree in library and information science. A year after I graduated I started
                                 working at the King Library in February 2012, and just finished my ninth year there.
                                 I love working in the MLK Library, and on the SJSU campus. San Jos State truly transformed
                                 my life!
Alec Giurlani
Academic Advisor, H&A Student Success Center
As a student at SJSU, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. The entire College of
                                 Humanities and the Arts was so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer
                                 journey. I never expected SJSU to be such a kind and loving family. Thankfully, I
                                 am now more than five years cancer-free and working full time at SJSU as an academic
                                 advisor. Im grateful for SJSU and the opportunity to give back.
Carl Henderson
04 African American Studies
My time at SJSU was a great transformation. As a transfer student from the U.S. Military
                                 Academy at West Point, I arrived in San Jos deflated and depressed. I found positivity
                                 and inspiration within the Xi Gamma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. After graduation
                                 I pursued coaching...with the life mission of encouraging students to have a dream
                                 and admonishing them to have courage through adversity. My time at SJSU, though full
                                 of trials and tribulations, was the greatest time of my life.
Marielle Lacanlale
22 Nursing
If I had not gone to SJSU to pursue nursing, I would not have been able to develop
                                 the work ethic that I have now to achieve my goals. SJSU has also provided me with
                                 a very strong Filipino community. I had also grown a very close knit friend group
                                 that has been able to support me in my journey throughout college. Now that I am in
                                 the nursing school here, SJSU has provided me with so many opportunities to make a
                                 difference within my community.
Alexandra Salazar
20 Molecular Biology
Coming to SJSU introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help
                                 transform me into the scientist I am becoming. Thanks to the resources and guidance
                                 I received at SJSU, I will begin pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at the Scripps Research
                                 Institute starting fall 2021.

17 MA Transportation Management
I completed a graduate degree from San Jose Stat University several years ago. Without
                                 this formal training, I dont know where Id be at this moment in my life. The education
                                 I received from San Jose Stat has given me the tools I need to advance my career
                                 upward.

                                 increase or modify any listed fees, without notice, until the date when instruction

                                 as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees, the
                                 Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees

                                 '25 Psychology
When I was a freshman, CAPISE was not established, and I felt very isolated and alone
                                 in my experience. CAPISE gave me a place to explore not only my cultural identity,
                                 but how my other identities inform and influence my experiences and time here at San
                                 Jose State. I feel more connected to myself, my peers, and my community.

                                 '25 Public Health
Student Affairs does a great job of empowering students to be innovators and create
                                 your own path to success. And I think that the Student Affairs' Student Involvement
                                 department is the #1 resource for students on campus.
                                 Hannah Bittar
                                 '23 Biology
One of the best decisions I made while being a student at SJSU is making the decision
                                 to be a Peer Educator for 3 years. I took on different roles to support and guide
                                 my fellow students. As an S.I. Leader for the first 2 years, I facilitated group tutoring
                                 sessions in Biology and Chemistry. These interactive sessions allowed my peers to
                                 grasp high-yield topics and enhance their academic success, which was very rewarding
                                 for me to witness. Thank you to Student Affairs and the Peer Connections team!

Legacy of Poetry
Poets have found inspiration and community at San Jose State since Edwin Markham wrote
                                    "The Man with the Hoe." SJSU celebrates this lyrical legacy every spring.

Commencement
Commencement is an honored tradition atall universities. At SJSU's spring and fall
                                    ceremonies, there's special element: the ceremonial mace. An ornamental staff or scepter,
                                    the mace is carried by officials as part of formal parliamentary or academic ceremonies.
                                    A gift from the Tower Foundation of SJSU, the universitys ceremonial mace was designed
                                    and created this spring by Art and Art History Lecturer Yvonne Escalante, 13 MFA
                                    Spatial Arts. She found inspiration for the design in both SJSU history and the paths
                                    students take to reach graduation.

                                    and Institutes (CCI) established within the university are recognized as efficient
                                    means to fulfill these functions. San Jos State University has nearly 30 CCI that

                                 increased future earnings and less than half the average student debt of their California
                                 counterparts. And they go on to work in some of the worlds most influential companies.
                                 As alumni of SJSU, they join our faculty and staff in positively impacting Silicon

Testimonials of Transformation
Cornelio (CJ) Balmaceda
20 Justice Studies
I was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to SJSU. But the
                                 moment I stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. One of the best ways
                                 SJSU transformed my life was by being introduced to lifelong friends and developing
                                 many connections. I will forever cherish my days at SJSU, and because I attended there,
                                 I am a better individual. Thank you SJSU!

                                 I was surrounded by people who wanted to make the world a better place. I now work
                                 at the San Francisco Zoo, which is dedicated to conservation, both local and distant.
                                 My studies at SJSU helped me see the plight of animals in a much larger context. Thank
                                 you, SJSU!

22 Physics
[My SJSU professor] gave me the courage that I had been longing for to pursue physics.
                                 Every day since then, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to pursue what
                                 I truly love.

I was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years when I decided to go back to school to get
                                 a master's degree in library and information science. A year after I graduated I started
                                 working at the King Library in February 2012, and just finished my ninth year there.
                                 I love working in the MLK Library, and on the SJSU campus. San Jos State truly transformed
                                 my life!

As a student at SJSU, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. The entire College of
                                 Humanities and the Arts was so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer
                                 journey. I never expected SJSU to be such a kind and loving family. Thankfully, I
                                 am now more than five years cancer-free and working full time at SJSU as an academic
                                 advisor. Im grateful for SJSU and the opportunity to give back.

My time at SJSU was a great transformation. As a transfer student from the U.S. Military
                                 Academy at West Point, I arrived in San Jos deflated and depressed. I found positivity
                                 and inspiration within the Xi Gamma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. After graduation
                                 I pursued coaching...with the life mission of encouraging students to have a dream
                                 and admonishing them to have courage through adversity. My time at SJSU, though full
                                 of trials and tribulations, was the greatest time of my life.

22 Nursing
If I had not gone to SJSU to pursue nursing, I would not have been able to develop
                                 the work ethic that I have now to achieve my goals. SJSU has also provided me with
                                 a very strong Filipino community. I had also grown a very close knit friend group
                                 that has been able to support me in my journey throughout college. Now that I am in
                                 the nursing school here, SJSU has provided me with so many opportunities to make a
                                 difference within my community.

Coming to SJSU introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help
                                 transform me into the scientist I am becoming. Thanks to the resources and guidance
                                 I received at SJSU, I will begin pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at the Scripps Research
                                 Institute starting fall 2021.

Wall Street Journal Ranks SJSU the #4 Public School in the Country by Ken Mashinchi | Sep 5, 2024 | Academics, Awards and Achievements, Featured
A new academic year is underway, and good news is already rolling in for San Jos State University. In the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and College Pulses 2025 Best Colleges in the U.S. rankings, released Thursday, SJSU ranked as the #4 best public university in the nation and #16 overall.
The rankings, which rate the top 500 universities in the country, measure how well each college sets graduates up for financial success, how much a school improves students chances of graduating and their future earnings and balances these outcomes with feedback from students on college life. SJSU vaulted 157 spots from last years overall rankings.
San Jos State is a premier public university in the country, and we are thrilled this ranking highlights what many Spartans already know  SJSU prepares students to succeed as graduates and transform their lives, said President Cynthia Teniente-Matson. We are the anchor institution of the Epicenter of the Future here in Silicon Valley, and our tremendous students, faculty, staff, alumni and community deserve the credit for making this university a world-class institution.
In additional rankings, SJSU ranked #5 among public universities, and #17 overall, for Best Salaries, which according to WSJ, lists schools in order of their impact on graduates salaries and how this relates to the cost of attending the college. The university also ranked #28 for social mobility and #42 for best value in the nation.
SJSU is no stranger to strong rankings from WSJ. Last year, SJSU earned several top rankings among public universities for salaries for graduates:
#1 in accounting
#2 in marketing
#4 in data science
#5 in engineering
#6 in software development

San Jos State Launches the College of Information, Data and Society (IDS) by sjsueditor | Sep 16, 2024 | Academics, Featured
San Jos States College of Information, Data and Society (IDS) is home to the iSchool and the Department of Applied Data Science.
San Jos State University has launched the College of Information, Data and Society (IDS), the first college of its kind in the CSU system.Under the leadership of Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Vincent Del Casino, Jr., IDS is home to the School of Information (iSchool) and the Department of Applied Data Science.
We are nationally and globally recognized for shaping the future of the workforce, preparing students for career paths that exist today and those that have yet to be created and all of this is being realized in this new college, said Del Casino.
The college, formed last spring, is being led by Interim Dean Michael Meth, who is also the dean of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library. This new college also represents a cross-campus strategy to expand access to degrees that crosscut information and data sciences, and gives SJSU the capacity to enhance its role as a workforce development leader in the fields of information and library science, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics and ethics, instructional design, and cybersecurity at the undergraduate and graduate levels. SJSU is launching a search for a permanent dean for IDS this fall.
Putting these programs together into one college is yet another example of SJSU maximizing its resources and innovating to the benefit of our students, said SJSU President Cynthia Teniente-Matson. We are at a pivotal moment in the future of information. SJSU intends to lead our students into that future, ensuring they will be well-prepared to meet this moment.
Vincent Del Casino, Jr. introduces the College of IDS.
The iSchool prepares students for careers as information professionals in diverse areas such as libraries and librarianship, user experience design, digital asset management, information architecture, electronic records management, information governance and digital preservation.
The Applied Data Science Department offers academic programs to address emerging workforce demands of interdisciplinary talents designing and deploying intelligent solutions to real-world data challenges.
The debut of IDS comes as SJSU prepares to host the annual Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) convening on campus November 7-8, 2024. PIT-UN is a collaboration among dozens of higher education institutions committed to building the field of public interest technology.

First-Year Writing Program Presents the Inaugural Digital Literacy Expo by Julia Halprin Jackson | Nov 4, 2024 | Academics, Featured

Photo by Jim Gensheimer.
First-year writing students will present interactive projects at the inaugural Digital Literacy Expo.
On November 22, San Jos States First-Year Writing (FYW) Program is proud to present its first-ever Digital Literacy Expo, an interactive showcase of student work spotlighting digital works in progress. The event is part of an ongoing digital literacy initiative supported by Adobe Systems and the Office of the Provost at SJSU, as well as a California State University Supported Pathways grant to support instruction in first-year writing.
Associate Professor of Rhetoric and Writing Ryan Skinnell serves as the director of the First-Year Writing Project and is partnering with Amanda Smith, coordinator of the Stretch English program (a one-year program that divides English 1A into two semesters), to host the event.
We define digital literacy in terms of texts, broadly defined, that appear in digital spaces, Skinnell says. If I write a paper for class, how might that be put into different media? It could be available to people on a website or turned into a video or podcast.
Participating students have the opportunity to present assignments created using a variety of Adobe tools. In addition to Skinnell and Smiths students, five other first-year writing classes will contribute work for the expo. Assignments are fairly open-ended, depending on the class; Skinnells students are expected to produce an op-ed about voting rights, while another instructors class is creating work that examines environmental texts. The event will take place in rooms 4A/4B on the second floor of the Lupe and Compean Diaz Student Union, where the public is invited to circulate to speak with students about their projects on display.
Mia Castillo Garcia, 28 Biological Sciences, plans to present a project dedicated to her family at the expo on Nov. 22.
In my English class, we were assigned to connect our favorite food with a memory [by creating] a web page, she explains. I immediately thought of lomo saltado (beef stir fry), my favorite Peruvian dish, which reminds me of an unforgettable and bittersweet memory of my mother teaching me how to make it while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.
Castillo Garcia adds that the assignment allowed her to share her story not only with words, but also images of the dish, creating a richer and more meaningful experience. The experience has also challenged her to experiment with various storytelling tools.
Learning to use AI-generated images and other digital tools has shown me the power of digital literacy, and I believe we should all embrace these tools to further our participation in todays society, she says. I discovered a love for turning my writing into web pages and videos which I might never have explored otherwise. Everyone can find a unique way to share their stories; its just a matter of finding what fits you best.
Emphasizing the creative process
Ryan Skinnell participated in SJSUs 2024 First-Year Writing Digital Literacy Symposium in August for writing teachers who want to learn to incorporate different modalities for composition into their teaching. Photo by Robert C. Bain.The Digital Literacy Expo offers a different way to think about the curriculum, says Skinnell. Were not replacing traditional essays by any stretch of the imagination, but were thinking about how students engage with writing and reading in their classes when they go to work out in the world.
Students are experimenting with Adobe products and other digital tools that sometimes incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), which Skinnell hopes will prompt productive dialogue about how to appropriately incorporate AI into creative and academic writing.
We as writing teachers now have the opportunity to think about what we bring to the work of teaching writing if a polished text can be produced by robots, he says. AI can produce at the drop of a hat, but it cant figure out how to work through feedback and incorporate things from class discussion over a series of iterations.
Those iterations make up the real act of writing and rewriting, he says, and offer students the chance to experiment with various forms of storytelling.
Skinnell hopes that the inaugural Digital Literacy Expo helps all First-Year Writing students understand that there are many ways to present their work, with an emphasis on the drafting, revising and rewriting processes.
Our students are starting to think really early in their first-year writing classes about how they write and produce the knowledge that will carry them through their majors, he says. The things that students produce may surprise them. Im very curious to see what they produce.

SJSU Named Fulbright HSI Leader by the U.S. Department of State for Fourth Year Running by Julia Halprin Jackson | Nov 8, 2024 | Awards and Achievements, Featured
SJSU has been named a 2023-2024 HSI Fulbright Leader by the U.S. Department of State. Photo by Javier Duarte.
Every year, the U.S. Department of States Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) recognizes select Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) as Fulbright HSI Leaders for their strong engagement with the Fulbright program. As of November 4, San Jos State is proud to be named a 2023-2024 Fulbright HSI Leader for the fourth consecutive year.
San Jos State is one of four California State Universities (CSUs) included in the list. The recognized colleges and universities include seven associates colleges, five baccalaureate colleges, two special focus institutions, 10 masters colleges and universities, and 28 doctoral universities.
The initiative encourages administrators, faculty and students at HSIs to engage with Fulbright and highlights the strength of HSIs as destinations for international students and scholars. The U.S. Department of State has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), the goal of which is to increase the awareness of and participation by the Hispanic community of the United States in the Fulbright Program and in other exchange programs supported by the U.S. Department of State.
I am confident that our engagement with the program will continue to grow as we advance our shared priority of teaching our talented and diverse students  the worlds future leaders  to become active and engaged participants in our increasingly interconnected, interdependent global economy and society, said CSU Chancellor Mildred Garca, a two-time Fulbrighter herself. My Fulbright experiences have enriched my personal and professional lives in immeasurable ways.
HSI students and faculty who have taken part in Fulbright opportunities come back to their campuses with new insights, and leaders of HACU-member institutions appreciate the long-term research partnerships and international collaborations made possible through Fulbright.
Scott Weinhold, Senior Bureau Official for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, commended the 2024 Fulbright HSI Leaders for their support of the Fulbright Program. Weinhold said, Fulbrighters from HSIs contribute to the Programs goal of reflecting the full diversity, perspectives, and talents of the American people. 
About the Fulbright Program
The Fulbright Program is the U.S. governments flagship international academic exchange program with a longstanding commitment to diversity, working to ensure that participants reflect the United States and societies abroad. The Fulbright Program works closely with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) to promote international exchange opportunities to staff, students and faculty at HSIs. This years Fulbright HSI Leaders were announced at the HACU Annual Conference. Fulbright also works with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the National Clearinghouse on Disability and Exchange, the American Association of Community Colleges, Diversity Abroad and many more organizations.
Since 1946, the Fulbright Program has provided more than 400,000 students, scholars, artists and teachers from all types of institutions the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research abroad. Fulbrighters build connections, gain experience, exchange ideas and address global challenges.
Fulbright is a program of the U.S. Department of State, with funding provided by the U.S. government. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the program.

San Jos State Joins Aqueous Battery Consortium for Clean Energy Storage by Cassie Myers | Sep 26, 2024 | Academics, Featured, Research and Innovation
Dahyun Oh, associate professor of materials engineering, in the Energy Materials Lab with students. Her Energy Materials Lab will contribute to the understanding of the interface between aqueous electrolytes and electrodes for the Aqueous Battery Consortium. Photo by Robert C. Bain.
San Jos State recently joined the Aqueous Battery Consortium, an energy hub research project supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) and led by Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The project aims to find a reliable, sustainable way to store electricity, partially by creating a rechargeable battery made mostly of water (the aqueous part of the consortium) and other abundant materials.
The project may receive up to $62.5 million over five years as part of the DOEs Energy Innovation Hubs program.
Current aqueous batteries, including lead-acid batteries, dont hold much energy, and the lead they contain is harmful. Lithium-ion batteries, another current option, arent cost-effective. This new consortium aims to make the new batteries more environmentally safe, much cheaper to produce and more efficient.
The team consists of 31 leading battery scientists, engineers and physicists from 12 universities in North America, as well as from SLAC, the U.S. Army Research Lab and the U.S. Naval Research Lab.
San Jos States contribution to the project comes through Dahyun Oh, associate professor of materials engineering. She is on two of the nine teams that structure the project: the interface team and the team on materials design and synthesis.
She adds, My lab, the Energy Materials Laboratory, will contribute to the understanding of the interface between aqueous electrolytes and electrodes. In batteries, interfaces play a crucial role in enabling battery reactions, and the interfacial behavior with aqueous electrolytes is less understood compared to organic electrolyte systems.
Her team feels grateful and fortunate to be included in this effort, which she believes will help people recognize the potential of SJSU, its faculty and its students.
This is an absolutely groundbreaking opportunity for my career, as well as for the SJSU students who will join this project, she says. Collaborative research is especially important for students at minority-serving institutions (MSI), as they have fewer opportunities to engage with graduate or postgraduate-level researchers. This consortium will provide a golden opportunity for students to learn, engage, develop research skills and build networks.
After all, a next-generation, environmentally-friendly battery could help power the world, and SJSU will be an integral part of this effort. As Oh concludes, We have numerous opportunities to offer, and our national recognition continues to grow.

Have you ever read a sentence and felt like there were way too many words in it? Here's an example: "For the first and earliest time in his short young life, Michael was experiencing and feeling the sensations commonly associated with love, an emotion he had never felt before. It's a common misconception among beginning writers that using more words makes one's writing sound more intelligent. The opposite is true. The trick to good writing is to say as much as you can in as few words as possible. Keep the good stuff, let the rest go. This workshop will explore strategies for recognizing and removing wordiness from your writing.

SJSU Theatre Presents: CABARET
Willkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome to the Kit Kat Club.
Home to an intimate and electrifying new production of CABARET. Experience this groundbreaking musical like never before. The denizens of the Kit Kat Club have created a decadent sanctuary inside San Joss Hammer Theatre, where artists and performers, misfits and outsiders rule the night. Step inside their world. This is Berlin. Relax. Loosen up. Be yourself. 
CABARET has music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb and a book by Joe Masteroff  based on the play by John Van Druten and stories by Christopher Isherwood.
Directed by Janie Scott
Performance dates are: Nov 15, 16, 21, 22, 23 at 7:30pm; Nov 20th at 11am (Student Matinee), and Sunday Matinee Nov 24 at 2pm
$10 Student Tickets
$20 Adult Tickets
$30 Onstage Cabaret Seating (Tickets under "General Seating")
As part of the Transforming Communities grant, we're delighted to offer free tickets to current SJSU students to attend the November 15th performance of Cabaret. Students who attend this performance can also participate in a short discussion, post-performance, exploring racial justice themes. Please contact fred.cohen@sjsu.edu if you're interested in a ticket!
Sponsored by the College of Humanities and the Arts Artistic Excellence Programming Grants. Cabaret is part of the series, Transforming Communities: A Movement to Racial Justice.

Next Steps for Fall2024
FreshmanTransferCurrent StudentsGraduate
What Students are Saying
As long as you put in the effort, study the material, take notes and go to online office hours, you can really learn. I knew that my professors were always available if I needed help. Despite the pandemic, I pushed myself and got straight As in fall 2020  Im proud of that. 
Joshua Reyes, 23 Marketing
I chose SJSU because I had heard so many good things about it, and once I went to Admitted Spartan Days, I knew that I felt at home. I loved the campus and it seemed like the perfect place to be able to meet new people and find my own place in the Spartan community.
Madison Wong, 23 Psychology
Everywhere else I had applied, I had seen or visited in person. But I realized that SJSU was a really solid option for me after I followed SJSU social media and attended the online Admitted Spartans activities. It was really nice attending all the online events with my parents in our living room. 
Cathy Hernandez, 24 Software Engineering

Cover - Fall 2024 - Washington Square: The Magazine
Find Your Perfect ReadFrom the EditorOne hundred years ago, San Jos State officially adopted the Spartan as our university mascot. But what is a Spartan at SJSU? A soldier, an athlete, a scholar, a professor? On our campus, a Spartan can be an engineer, an educator, an artist, a philosopher, a scientist  an advocate for justice and equality.In my eight years interviewing SJSU students, alumni, faculty, staff and community members, Ive observed that Spartans share a common value: A strong desire to create a better world.Some lay the foundation on the mat in the dojo,  la Yoshihiro Uchida, 47 Biological Sciences, 04 Honorary Doctorate, who dedicated more than 75 years to training Olympic-caliber judokas. Others establish spaces like the Kogura Gifts store in San Joss historic Japantown, surviving and thriving beyond World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. No mention of San Jos State athletics history would be complete without the late Lawrence Fan, proverbial torchbearer for generations of student-athletes, coaches and sports media professionals.Some Spartans make their mark in the arts and sciences. Pioneering Professor Emerita of Music Charlene Archibeque paved the way for singers, performing artists and music educators. Librarian Mychal Threets, 18 MLIS, has expanded the definition of library joy by creating inclusive spaces in the public library and online. As for the future: the skys the limit for Spartan entrepreneurs seeking innovative solutions in every field.While we shed light on tremendous Spartan achievements, we also recognize how common it is to encounter impostor syndrome  the perception that we dont belong. It is hard to learn, teach and achieve when faced with institutionalized and systemic obstacles. And yet, our students, faculty, alumni and staff prove day in and day out that San Jos State is a place for firsts: first public university on the West Coast, first city-university library, first-generation students.Theres no way to squeeze a centurys worth of Spartans into 32 pages, which is why we invite you to contribute to the San Jos State story. Tell us about the spaces you found at SJSU  or the places youve created since. Show us what being a Spartan means to you.Share your Spartan storyNone of this storytelling is possible without my fellow writers  Cassie Myers, Michelle Smith McDonald, Lesley Seacrist, Amy Villa; our trusty art director and designer Pourya Nadimi; our amazing creative director Michelle Frey; our fantastic illustrator Sierra Ferrato; expert photographers Jim Gensheimer and Robert C. Bain; Interim Associate Vice President of Strategic Communications and Marketing Kenneth Mashinchi; and most of all, to the Spartans whose stories enthrall and inspire us every day.In gratitude,Julia Halprin JacksonFrom the EditorOne hundred years ago, San Jos State officially adopted the Spartan as our university mascot. But what is a Spartan at SJSU? A soldier, an athlete, a scholar, a professor? On our campus, a Spartan can be an engineer, an educator, an artist, a philosopher, a scientist  an advocate for justice and equality.In my eight years interviewing SJSU students, alumni, faculty, staff and community members, Ive observed that Spartans share a common value: A strong desire to create a better world.Some lay the foundation on the mat in the dojo,  la Yoshihiro Uchida, 47 Biological Sciences, 04 Honorary Doctorate, who dedicated more than 75 years to training Olympic-caliber judokas. Others establish spaces like the Kogura Gifts store in San Joss historic Japantown, surviving and thriving beyond World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. No mention of San Jos State athletics history would be complete without the late Lawrence Fan, proverbial torchbearer for generations of student-athletes, coaches and sports media professionals.Some Spartans make their mark in the arts and sciences. Pioneering Professor Emerita of Music Charlene Archibeque paved the way for singers, performing artists and music educators. Librarian Mychal Threets, 18 MLIS, has expanded the definition of library joy by creating inclusive spaces in the public library and online. As for the future: the skys the limit for Spartan entrepreneurs seeking innovative solutions in every field.While we shed light on tremendous Spartan achievements, we also recognize how common it is to encounter impostor syndrome  the perception that we dont belong. It is hard to learn, teach and achieve when faced with institutionalized and systemic obstacles. And yet, our students, faculty, alumni and staff prove day in and day out that San Jos State is a place for firsts: first public university on the West Coast, first city-university library, first-generation students.Theres no way to squeeze a centurys worth of Spartans into 32 pages, which is why we invite you to contribute to the San Jos State story.

Accreditation Review Committee
The Accreditation Review Committee was established by the SJSU Academic Senate in
                                 2016.
The committee's key responsibilities include:
Fostering campus engagement in re-accreditation activities,
Encouraging continuous improvement focused on student learning, and
Leading the campus in preparing for accreditation review.
Institutional Accreditation
San Jos State University (SJSU) is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), an accrediting agency serving higher education institutions throughout the U.S.
                                 and around the world, with most institutions historically in California, Hawaii, and
                                 the Pacific region.
The Commission serves to ensure success for all students by assisting institutions
                                 in developing and sustaining effective educational programs and assuring the educational
                                 community, parents, students, employers and the public that the institution meets
                                 the high standards of quality and effectiveness. 
Accreditation is also necessary for participation in Title IV federal funding and
                                 state financial aid programs.
The WSCUC Institutional Directory provides additional information related to SJSU's accreditation.
Programmatic (Specialized) Accreditation
Several SJSU programs are accredited by professional specialized accreditation organizations.

                                    SJSU data-informed decision-making and compliance with state, federal, district, and
                                    college requirements.

Introducing the Office for Title IX and Equal Opportunity
The Office for Title IX and Equal Opportunity combines two prior offices: the Title
                                    IX and Gender Equity Office and the Office for Equal Opportunity. We created this
                                    new office to simplify the reporting process by establishing one place for all reports
                                    of protected status discrimination and harassment, including sex-based harassment,
                                    sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, and related retaliation.
                                    The office will offer support and resources for those who are impacted by protected

Title IX at SJSU
Title IX Annual Report Interactive Dashboard AY 2023-24
Title IX Annual Report AY 2023-24
There is an important distinction between a report and a complaint. A report is
                                    any information received by the then-Title IX Office about suspected Title IX misconduct,
                                    and can be made by anyone who is aware of that information. A report could come from
                                    the person who experienced the harm, a concerned community member, or a Responsible
                                    Employee. A complaint is an official request for an investigation and may only be
                                    made by the person who experienced the harm, or the university.  A complaint results
                                    in an investigation where the facts, taken as true, establish a possible violation
                                    of the CSU Nondiscrimination Policy. Because we generally only initiate an investigation
                                    upon request, the number of reports reflected in the data is greater than the number
                                    of investigations opened by the Title IX Office.

SJSUs Statement of Nondiscrimination
The University is dedicated to the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination.
                                    These principles permeate all facets of university life: in the admission, housing
                                    and education of students; in policies and practices governing programs of extracurricular
                                    life and activities; and in the employment of faculty, staff, and students. Discrimination
                                    of any kind, including, but not limited to age, ancestry, color, creed, disability,
                                    marital status, medical condition, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex,
                                    or sexual orientation, is an affront to the entire university community and is strictly
                                    prohibited.
SJSUs Title IX Statement of Nondiscrimination
SJSU is committed to maintaining an inclusive community that values diversity and
                                    fosters tolerance and mutual respect. SJSU does not discriminate, and does not tolerate
                                    discrimination, on the basis of sex or gender, which includes gender identity, gender
                                    expression, sexual orientation or sex stereotype in its education programs or activities.
                                    Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and certain other federal and state
                                    laws, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in employment, as well as in all
                                    education programs and activities operated by the university (both on and off campus).
                                    The protection against discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation
                                    includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and dating and domestic violence, and
                                    stalking.

Commitment to Diversity
San Jose State is unique in its storied and long history of student civil rights activism,
                                 service to first-generation student populations, racial and ethnic diversity, and
                                 location in the vibrant cultural communities and robust economy of the Silicon Valley
                                 of California.The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion [ODEI]is dedicated
                                 to the standards of inclusive excellence, which view San Jose State's mission of academic
                                 excellence as inseparable from our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.The
                                 ODEI works to create a campus community that is free from discrimination and free
                                 from systemic and cultural barriers to academic and professional success for all of
                                 its students, faculty, staff and administrators. The ODEI envisions a campus where
                                 its members engage in robust intergroup dialogue, and collaboration across groups,
                                 divisions and silos.

Working to Combat Systemic Racism at SJSU
Though we are proud to be one of the most diverse campus communities in the nation,
                                    action is needed more than ever to address systemic racism at San Jos State University.
                                    And action is what we are taking. The Presidents Leadership team on Equity and Justice
                                    is facilitating and coordinating the universitys initiatives on racial equity and
                                    justice. This leadership team is charged with understanding the initiatives being
                                    generated on campus and the tracking of the follow-through in achieving the goals
                                    of those initiatives. Learn about SJSUs immediate stepsas well as intermediate and
                                    long-term plansto create permanent organizational change with regard to systemic
                                    racism on our campus.
COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias
COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias
Anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of bias have
                                    always been with us. The current pandemic has seen an exponential rise in anti-Asian
                                    discrimination and milder microaggressions. We recognize the horrific disparities
                                    in higher morbidity and infection rates for Black/African Americans, Native Americans,
                                    and Latinx peoples from COVID-19 across the country. These collective realities have
                                    a great impact on the climate, organizational identity, and retention of employees.
                                    Crafted within the complex cultural and political contexts of the Bay Area, this webinar
                                    will (1) introduce historical and social psychological frameworks for organizational
                                    leaders and team members to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 xenophobia and bias,
                                    and (2) offer research-informed interventions and strategies to address anti-Asian
                                    bias incidents when they occur in the context of crisis. Target participants span
                                    from team members to people who hold positions of leadership in their organizations.

Muwekma Ohlone SJSU Area Land Acknowledgement
The San Jos State University community recognizes that the present-day Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, with an enrolled Bureau of Indian Affairs documented membership of over 550, is
                  comprised of all of the known surviving American Indian lineages aboriginal to the
                  San Francisco Bay region who trace their ancestry through the Missions Santa Clara,
                  San Jos, and Dolores, during the advent of the Hispano-European empire into Alta
                  California; and who are the successors and living members of the sovereign, historic,
                  previously Federally Recognized Verona Band of Alameda County.
Furthermore, the San Jos State University community recognizes that the university
                  is established within the Thamien Ohlone-speaking tribal ethnohistoric territory,
                  which based upon the unratified federal treaties of 1851-1852, includes the unceded
                  ancestral lands of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of
                  the enrolled Muwekma lineages are descended from direct ancestors from the Thamien
                  Ohlone tribal territory whose ancestors had affiliation with Mission Santa Clara.
The San Jos State University community also recognizes the importance of this land
                  to the indigenous Muwekma Ohlone people of this region, and consistent with our principles
                  of community and diversity strives to be good stewards on behalf of the Muwekma Ohlone
                  Tribe whose land we occupy.
The portion of this video above (beginning at 6:25) provides important context for
                  the Land Acknowledgement that was generously given to SJSU by the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe
                  for SJSU use. Tribe Chairwoman Charlene Nijmeh gives a powerful detailed accounting
                  of the specific steps and history of the disenfranchisement of the Muwekma Ohlone
                  peoples, as well as the strength and presence of their community today. Tribe Vice
                  Chairwoman Monica V. Arellano gives a detailed context to understand our presence
                  on the ancestral lands of the Muwekma Ohlone, land on which our institution and the
                  city of San Jose occupy. Their leadership reminds us of how much further we have
                  to go, and that this Land Acknowledgement is a very small step towards further action.
We are grateful for Charlene Nijmeh and Monica V. Arellano of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribal Council for providing SJSU with a Land Acknowledgement and Greeting.
We encourage you to use the Land Acknowledgment in its entirety out of respect for
                  the process and words given us by the Muwekma Ohlone.

Privacy Notice
Privacy
Last Updated: June 12, 2024
San Jos State University respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it
                     to the extent possible, subject to applicable state and federal law, through our compliance
                     with our privacy policies and this Privacy Notice.
This Notice applies to the information that we collect when you visit the SJSU's main
                     website www.sjsu.edu and other websites that we own or control, and on which we have
                     linked or referred to this Notice (together, the "Sites"). This Notice describes how this information is collected, processed, maintained,
                     protected, and disclosed. Unless otherwise indicated on a specific Site, the California
                     State University is the data controller for all information collected under this Notice.
                     Contact information for the CSU is listed at the end of this Notice.
This Notice does not apply to information collected from or about current or former
                     employees, contractors, volunteers, and other workers at SJSU as part of their employment
                     or working relationship with SJSU.
Except as specifically described, our Sites are operated in accordance with the laws
                     of the United States. Please read this Notice carefully to understand our policies
                     and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. This Notice reflects
                     the University's current practices and may change from time to time, so please check
                     the Notice periodically for updates.
Personal Information we collect and process
In this Notice, "personal information" means any information that identifies or describes
                     an individual user of the Sites, including, but not limited to, the user's name, social
                     security number, physical description, address, telephone number, education, financial
                     matters, medical or employment history, password, email address, and information that
                     reveals any network location or identity. If you are located in the European Economic
                     Area (EEA), "personal information" includes all personal data as defined under EEA
                     laws (including "sensitive personal information" which is provided enhanced protections
                     under those laws).
We collect personal information about users only as allowed by law and limit the collection
                     of personal information to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose
                     of the University. We collect personal information (and sensitive personal information)
                     that you send to the CSU, or permit us to obtain from third parties, for purposes
                     relevant to CSU operations in pursuit of our academic mission. Examples include information
                     needed for student admission (including financial aid information), employment, housing
                     and dining services, online educational programs, research, health services, donor
                     relations, visa application processing, event registration, parking services, IT usage
                     and support services, library usage, bookstore operations, and website account registrations.
                     Our legal basis for processing most of this information is to perform a task in the
                     public interest or in fulfillment of CSU official functions, including those set out
                     in the California Education Code and/or Title V of the California Code of Regulations,
                     or under applicable federal law. Other legal bases for processing information include
                     processing necessary for contract (e.g., to process parking permit payments), for
                     legitimate interests (e.g., to send requested information) or consent (e.g., to process
                     certain sensitive personal information).
User-Provided Information
You may be required to provide personal information to access or use certain parts
                     of our Sites, or features of our Sites or services, including without limitation,

                     our programs, special events or promotions, contact us with a comment, question or
                     complaint, etc. If you do not provide the requested personal information, you may
                     not be able to access or use the features of our Sites or service where such information
                     is requested.
Depending upon the nature of the transaction, the personal information that you may
                     provide may include: contact information (name, home or mailing address, telephone
                     number, social media username/handle, mobile phone and/or email address, etc.); academic
                     area or interest; financial information (financial aid application history, payment
                     history, social security number, passport number, credit card number, donation attribution
                     and amount, etc.); health record information (medical record number), allergies, past
                     medical history, family history, current medications, current medical conditions)
                     demographic information (age, birthdate, marital status, income, etc.); and profile
                     information (admissions date, graduation date, alumni status, student identification
                     number, username, password, relationship to the University, etc.).
Emails and Social Media Sites
If you correspond with us by email, mail or via social media, we may retain the content
                     of your communication or social media posting, the email or social media account address
                     from which it is sent, and our response. We collect information automatically using
                     technology when you visit our Sites or social media pages or when you open one of
                     our emails as described in this Notice.
The specific personal information (and sensitive personal information) we collect,
                     why we collect it, and our legal basis for processing it, is periodically reassessed
                     in applicable data process flow assessments or Data Protection Impact Assessments,
                     as relevant.
It is the policy of the California State University to limit the collection and safeguard
                     the privacy of personal information collected or maintained by the University. The
                     University's information management practices conform to the requirements of the Information
                     Practices Act of 1977 (Civil Code Section 1798, et seq.), the Public Records Act (California Government Code Section 6250, et seq.), California Government Code Section 11015.5, the Family Educational Rights and
                     Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C.  1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), and other applicable laws
                     pertaining to information privacy. In the event of a conflict between this Notice
                     and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, FERPA, or other law governing
                     the disclosure of University records, the applicable law will control.
Any information acquired by the University through the Sites is subject to the limitations
                     set forth in the Information Practices Act. The University will not distribute or
                     share electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d)
                     of California Government Code Section 11015.5) about users to any third party without
                     the permission of the user, except in narrow circumstances set forth in this Notice.
                     The University will not sell any electronically collected personal information to
                     any third party. Such electronically-collected personal information is exempt from
                     requests made pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing
                     with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1).

                     a string of alphanumeric characters  to your computer that uniquely identifies your
                     browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the

                     is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly
                     if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Google Analytics
We use a tool called "Google Analytics," a web analytics service provided by Google,
                     Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. We use Advertising Features within
                     Google Analytics, including Google Signals, remarketing with Google Analytics, Google
                     Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google  Console. Google Analytics
                     collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited,
                     demographics and interests reporting, and what other sites were visited prior to coming
                     to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve
                     the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date
                     you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google
                     Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type of web browser, type
                     of operating system, browser resolution, and network location, however we do not combine
                     the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable
                     information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser
                     to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the cookie cannot
                     be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected
                     by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites
                     by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you
                     may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites. You may also opt-out of
                     the Google Analytics Advertising Features through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile
                     apps, or any other available means, such as the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.
Log File Information
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access
                     a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record
                     certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These
                     server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses
                     or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating
                     system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs,
                     domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Clear Gifs Information
When you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which
                     are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal
                     information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear
                     gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
California Do Not Track Disclosures
California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January
                     1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator
                     responds to "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some
                     browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing
                     is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.
                     We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users'
                     online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses
                     our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.
How we share your information
We share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes
                     listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process
                     your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors
                     who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid
                     or payment processing, education management, and web hosting). The University may
                     also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators
                     (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement
                     applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue
                     available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal
                     information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other
                     University policies and applicable laws and regulations. We will not distribute or
                     share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision
                     (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party
                     without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving
                     possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including
                     but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency
                     or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network
                     operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.
We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our
                     Sites or services for illegal activities. We may report to law enforcement agencies
                     any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal
                     information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity,
                     including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or
                     litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law
                     or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant
                     permission to us in accordance with this Notice.
How we protect your information
We take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the
                     integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access,
                     and illegal use or disclosure. Such personal information is stored by the University
                     in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management
                     of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access
                     to personal information is limited to those members of the University's staff whose
                     work requires such access. Confidential information is destroyed according to the
                     University's records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews
                     to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood
                     and followed.
The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember
                     that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is
                     100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your
                     personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information
                     you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission
                     of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of
                     our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information
                     may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
                     technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information
                     and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.
We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers
                     and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy
                     and security, please see the University's policies and procedures related to Information Security [pdf]; you may also consult with the California Attorney General's Privacy Enforcement and Protection website.
In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security,
                     we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has
                     been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU
                     Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
Links to Other Websites
We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our
                     Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either
                     express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy,
                     completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor
                     do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright,
                     trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such
                     site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination. We may provide links
                     to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites
                     does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites. Please
                     remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, our Notice
                     is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including
                     those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.
                     Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the
                     security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU,
                     nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless
                     we specifically state so. We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third
                     party site at any time.
Access and choice
We comply with all applicable regulations regarding data retention and deletion of
                     personal data and retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill
                     the purpose for which it was collected (including for college operations), for strategic
                     planning, and to comply with applicable laws and retention requirements. You can ask
                     to review, update or make changes to the personal information we maintain about you,
                     or exercise your option of having your personal information discarded without reuse
                     or distribution, by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out
                     below. We may take a reasonable period of time to respond. If you request the deactivation
                     or change of information on our system, such information may be retained in our backup
                     systems for a period of time subject to technology restrictions, or as a precaution
                     against systems failures. Some information may be retained for longer periods as required
                     by law, contract or auditing requirements or as otherwise described in this Notice.
You have the option to decline providing information about yourself online and may
                     use other methods, such as U.S. mail, to respond to requests for information or to
                     communicate with us. You may use the contact information listed below to ask about
                     additional alternatives to providing or obtaining information through use of our Sites.
By providing us your email address, you consent to our use of your email address to
                     send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law,
                     in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send
                     you other messages, including, but not limited to, newsletters, information on campus
                     activities, programs and events, legal updates, changes to features of our Sites or
                     services, or other account information. Where required by law, we will obtain your
                     consent before sending you specific types of email or other communications.
You can choose not to receive such emails from us by "unsubscribing" using the instructions
                     in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or
                     email address set out below. It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to
                     process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account
                     or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. Opting out does
                     not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our
                     use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.
EEA Data Subject Rights
If you are an individual located in the EEA only, you have certain rights with regard
                     to your personal data collected while you are in the EEA. These rights may include
                     right of access, right of correction, right to be forgotten, right to restrict processing
                     of your identifiable personal information, right to notice related to changes/deletion/processing
                     limits, right to data portability, right to objection, right not to be subject to
                     decisions based solely on automated processing, and right to withdraw consent. Some
                     of these rights are restricted by law to information that was collected on the basis
                     of explicit consent, or are restricted by other conditions (such as necessity for
                     contract or to comply with the law). You have the right to contact us in connection
                     with the exercise of your rights under applicable EEA law, which you can do through
                     the contact information below, or by sending an email to privacy@calstate.edu. We will respond to your written request without unreasonable delay and in accordance
                     with any deadlines imposed by law. Unless we notify you at the time of your request,
                     we will not charge you any fee in connection with the exercise of your rights. If
                     you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to complain to or seek
                     advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against us in any court of
                     competent jurisdiction.
Changes to Our Privacy Notice
We reserve the right to modify this Notice at any time. It is our policy to provide
                     notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for other operational
                     purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous
                     posting of such notice on our Sites page, as determined by the University in its sole
                     discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications
                     to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described
                     in this Notice. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and
                     deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Sites and this
                     Notice to check for any changes.
For changes to our Privacy Notice, it is our policy to post any changes we make on
                     this page. The date the Notice was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
                     We will provide notice on the Sites, or at www.sjsu.edu, prior to the effective date
                     of any change. Your continued use of the Sites after any change in this Notice will
                     constitute your acceptance of such change.

2024 Christa McAuliffe Excellence in Teacher Education Award Recipient 
The Connie L. Lurie College of Education is proud to receive the 2024 Christa McAuliffe
                                    Award; Diversifying the Teacher Pipeline from the American Association of State Colleges
                                    and Universities. The Christa McAuliffe Award has long honored exemplary teacher education
                                    programs at AASCU member campuses that can document the success of their graduates
                                    in improving P-12 pupil learning outcomes. The award recognizes programs that have
                                    been adapted using evidence of P-12 impact in their pre-service and in-service programs.
You Belong at Lurie College!
At the SJSU Lurie College of Education, you will gain the skills and knowledge to
                                    prepare yourself for a future as a transformative educator, counselor, therapist,
                                    or school and community leader.  Experience an emancipatory approach while you explore
                                    teaching, scholarship, and service opportunities.
The Male Educators of Color Initiative
Men of Color have a profound impact on student success in our K12 classrooms.  
                                    The Male Educators of Color Initiative is open to all SJSU teacher credential candidates
                                    committed to combating the systemic and interpersonal barriers that disproportionately
                                    impede and discourage men of color from entering the teaching profession. The MECI
                                    does not consider race, color, national origin, sex, or any other protected status
                                    for candidates seeking to participate in MECI programs and activities. 
Join a community of committed educators to make a difference in our schools, communities,

Food Assistance
Are you finding yourself struggling to afford food while attending SJSU? You are not
                  alone. The most recent Student Affairs survey found that approximately half of SJSU
                  students are sometimes skipping meals due to cost.
The good news is SJSU Cares has two great programs to help:
Spartan Food Pantry
CalFresh Application Assistance
These programs can help you get the food you need to focus on your education. Additionally,
                  there are many other food resources available on campus and in the surrounding community.
Housing Assistance
As a student, you may find yourself unexpectedly homeless if you lack stable, regular
                  and adequate housing. You may be homeless if you are living in shelters, parks, motels
                  or cars, or temporarily couch-surfing with other people because you have nowhere else
                  to go.
If you are living in any of these situations because you are fleeing an abusive parent
                  or guardian, you may be considered homeless even if they would provide support and
                  a place to live. Or you may have an unexpected eviction, fire or other disaster where
                  you are living.
Housing insecurity is a real issue in Silicon Valley.Please contact SJSU Caresif you are in an emergency situation!
Medical Assistance
Skipping an urgent medical or dental appointment because a lack of resources or insurance
                  can lead to an unhealthy situation. Unexpected medical bills can seriously impact
                  a student's monthly budget.
Contact SJSU Cares to find out what resources are available to help you pay for medical bills or insurance.
                  We want to help you stay healthy!
Emergency/Disaster Assistance
Students share with us when they may have been a victim of a crime such as theft or
                  burglary, or of a natural disaster like fire or flood, which has negatively affected
                  their ability to succeed on campus.
If you are facing any kind of emergency situation, contact SJSU Caresto find support and resources.
Clothing Assistance
The Career Closet, operated by the Career Center, has a focus on providing students with free professional
                  clothing and up to one full professional outfit per academic year. This can assist
                  with interviews, job fairs, etc.  thier websiteto make an appointment.
Parenting Students Assistance
California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
The California Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) promotes the health of low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding people,
                  infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing nutritious
                  food to supplement diets, information on healthy eating including breastfeeding promotion
                  and support, and referrals to health care. You may qualify if you receive Medi-Cal,
                  CalWORKs (TANF) or CalFresh (SNAP) benefits. WIC welcomes military families, migrant
                  families, fathers, foster parents and legal guardians with eligible children. Participating
                  in the WIC program does not affect the immigration status of anyone currently in the
                  U.S. Use the WIC eligibility assessment tool to see if you qualify. Set up an appointment at a WIC local agency near you. 
                  the website for WIC families to find a WIC local agency site near you.
Diapers
Multiple community based agencies indicate that they have assistance with diapers
                  through their programs. Knowing that our students live in many communities it is best
                  to search for diaper assistance by your location.
Personal Hygiene Products
The Spartan Food Pantry offers menstrual hygiene products for its users. See the pantry website for eligibility.
For general locations of free sanitary products on campus visit the Gender Equity Center Sanitary Products page.

Free Speech at SJSU
San Jos State University believes that freedom of expression is a cornerstone of
                                    a democratic society and essential to the educational process. Universities like SJSU
                                    have a special obligation to encourage and support the free expression of ideas, values,
                                    and opinions, even when they may be unpopular or controversial. The university shall
                                    ensure that individuals and groups are afforded wide latitude in exercising the right
                                    of free expression and that their constitutionally protected right to free expression
                                    is protected while on campus. Freedom of expression, however, is not an absolute right
                                    and it coexists with other rights and the need for public safety.

CSU Interim Free Expression and Time, Place, and Manner Policy
The California State University systemwide Interim Free Expression and Time, Place
                                 and Manner policy provides regulations to ensure that those who participate in lawful
                                 expressive activities are protected and do not disrupt university operations or infringe
                                 on the rights of others. SJSU has produced an additional addendum specific to the
                                 main campus and affiliated locations.
What is Freedom of Speech?
Learn how the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and how this right is protected
                                 here at SJSU.
Is There Any Speech Prohibited by the First Amendment?
The First Amendment does not prohibit any speech, but there are some types of speech
                                 for which there is no, or very limited, First Amendment protection.
Recognized Student Organizations
SJSU has more than 350 Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs) spanning a wide array
                                 of topics, interests and viewpoints. RSOs are free to invite speakers to campus and
                                 provide access to campus venues.
Election Activities and Other Advocacy
SJSU encourages our Spartan community to be civically engaged and make their voices
                                    heard on the issues they care about. Learn more about the universitys status as a
                                    public institution informs what organized activities and use of public resources are
                                    allowed within the public university context.

Parenting Students
SJSU provides a range of services, resources, and referrals to ensure that pregnant
                  and parenting students have equitable educational opportunities. By offering things
                  like Priority Registration, Basic Needs Assistance, and On-Campus Childcare, SJSU
                  is dedicated to nurturing an environment in which pregnant and parenting students
                  can achieve academic success. All offerings are in compliance with California Assembly Bill 2881.
Priority Registration
Students who identify as parents in their CSU application will be able to register
                  early on all CSU campuses starting in the Fall 2024 registration period. SJSUs Office of the Registrar will provide updates on this process as they become available.
Basic Needs Assistance
Basic needs support, including financial, food, housing, clothing, and technology
                  assistance, is available to all SJSU students on the SJSU Cares Get Assistance page. Pregnant and parenting students may qualify for additional on- and off-campus assistance.
On-Campus Childcare
The Child Development Center offers on-campus childcare that is licensed by the California Department of Social
                  Services and operates under guidelines established by the California Department of
                  Education Child Development Division. Parenting Students must apply in advance to
                  secure an opening for their dependent.
Pregnant and Parenting Student Rights
The Title IX and Gender Equity Office ensures that students and employees are protected from discrimination based on pregnancy
                  and pregnancy-related conditions. The Report an Incident page provides a path to report any kind of gender based discrimination or harassment,
                  including pregnancy-related discrimination.
The SJSUs Notice of Nondiscrimination page further details the protections SJSU provides against discrimination relating to
                  pregnancy and/or parenting.
The Pregnancy and Parenting Support page contains information on temporary medical leaves, lactation rooms, and other support.
