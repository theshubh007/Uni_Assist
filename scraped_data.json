All CSU listed fees should be regarded\n                                 as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees, the\n                                 Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate.

I took on different roles to support and guide\n                                 my fellow students. As an S.I. Leader for the first 2 years, I facilitated group tutoring\n                                 sessions in Biology and Chemistry. These interactive sessions allowed my peers to\n                                 grasp high-yield topics and enhance their academic success, which was very rewarding\n                                 for me to witness.

Our students’ trajectory\n                                 is upward, regardless of where they start. They have the opportunity to graduate with\n                                 increased future earnings and less than half the average student debt of their California\n                                 counterparts. And they go on to work in some of the world’s most influential companies.\n                                 As alumni of SJSU, they join our faculty and staff in positively impacting Silicon\n                                 Valley, the Bay Area and beyond. We are SJSU — transformation defined. \nShare Your Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimonials of Transformation\n\n\n\n\n\nCornelio (CJ) Balmaceda\n’20 Justice Studies\n“I was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to SJSU. But the\n                                 moment I stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. One of the best ways\n                                 SJSU transformed my life was by being  introduced to lifelong friends and developing\n                                 many connections. I will forever cherish my days at SJSU, and because I attended there,\n                                 I am a better individual. Thank you SJSU!”\n\n\n\nTara Caughlan\n’16 MA Environmental Studies\n“I met so many amazing students and staff at SJSU. In the environmental studies program,\n                                 I was surrounded by people who wanted to make the world a better place. I now work\n                                 at the San Francisco Zoo, which is dedicated to conservation, both local and distant.\n                                 My studies at SJSU helped me see the plight of animals in a much larger context. Thank\n                                 you, SJSU!”\n\n\n\nTommy Wen Chin\n’22 Physics\n“[My SJSU professor] gave me the courage that I had been longing for to pursue physics.\n                                 Every day since then, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to pursue what\n                                 I truly love.”\n\n\n\nLaurel Eby\n’10 MA Library and Information Science\n“I was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years when I decided to go back to school to get\n                                 a master's degree in library and information science. A year after I graduated I started\n                                 working at the King Library in February 2012, and just finished my ninth year there.\n                                 I love working in the MLK Library, and on the SJSU campus. San José State truly transformed\n                                 my life!”\n\n\n\nAlec Giurlani\nAcademic Advisor, H&A Student Success Center\n“As a student at SJSU, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. The entire College of\n                                 Humanities and the Arts was so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer\n                                 journey. I never expected SJSU to be such a kind and loving family. Thankfully, I\n                                 am now more than five years cancer-free and working full time at SJSU as an academic\n                                 advisor. I’m grateful for SJSU and the opportunity to give back.”\n\n\n\nCarl Henderson\n’04 African American Studies\n“My time at SJSU was a great transformation. As a transfer student from the U.S. Military\n                                 Academy at West Point, I arrived in San José deflated and depressed. I found positivity\n                                 and inspiration within the Xi Gamma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. After graduation\n                                 I pursued coaching...with the life mission of ‘encouraging students to have a dream\n                                 and admonishing them to have courage through adversity.’ My time at SJSU, though full\n                                 of trials and tribulations, was the greatest time of my life.”\n\n\n\nMarielle Lacanlale\n’22 Nursing\n“If I had not gone to SJSU to pursue nursing, I would not have been able to develop\n                                 the work ethic that I have now to achieve my goals. SJSU has also provided me with\n                                 a very strong Filipino community. I had also grown a very close knit friend group\n                                 that has been able to support me in my journey throughout college. Now that I am in\n                                 the nursing school here, SJSU has provided me with so many opportunities to make a\n                                 difference within my community.”\n\n\n\nAlexandra Salazar\n’20 Molecular Biology\n“Coming to SJSU introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help\n                                 transform me into the scientist I am becoming. Thanks to the resources and guidance\n                                 I received at SJSU, I will begin pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at the Scripps Research\n                                 Institute starting fall 2021.”\n\n\n\nNorman K. Tuitavuki\n’17 MA Transportation Management\n“I completed a graduate degree from San Jose Staté University several years ago. Without\n                                 this formal training, I don’t know where I’d be at this moment in my life. The education\n                                 I received from San Jose Staté has given me the tools I need to advance my career\n                                 upward.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\nSan José State University\n\nSJSU on Facebook\nSJSU on Twitter\nSJSU on LinkedIn\nSJSU on Instagram\nSJSU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Washington SquareSan José, CA 95192\n408-924-1000\nSJSU Online\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nAccreditation\nTitle IX\nDiversity\nLand Acknowledgement\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n\nColleges\n\nBusiness\nEducation\nEngineering\nGraduate Studies\nHealth and Human Sciences\nHumanities and the Arts\nInformation, Data and Society\nProfessional Education\nScience\nSocial Science\n\n\n\nResources\n\nA-Z Index\nAnnual Security Report [pdf]\nBookstore\nCalendars\nCareers and Jobs\nCatalog\nCurrent Students\nEmergency Food & Housing\nFaculty & Staff\nFreedom of Speech\nKing Library\nNewsCenter\nParenting Students\nParking and Maps\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nContact Form\nDirectory\nDoing Business with SJSU\nEmergency Info\nFile a Complaint\nReport a Title IX Complaint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Last Updated Apr 6, 2024\n\n"

Our students’ trajectory\n                                 is upward, regardless of where they start. They have the opportunity to graduate with\n                                 increased future earnings and less than half the average student debt of their California\n                                 counterparts. And they go on to work in some of the world’s most influential companies.\n                                 As alumni of SJSU, they join our faculty and staff in positively impacting Silicon\n                                 Valley, the Bay Area and beyond. We are SJSU — transformation defined. \nShare Your Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimonials of Transformation\n\n\n\n\n\nCornelio (CJ) Balmaceda\n’20 Justice Studies\n“I was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to SJSU. But the\n                                 moment I stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. One of the best ways\n                                 SJSU transformed my life was by being  introduced to lifelong friends and developing\n                                 many connections. I will forever cherish my days at SJSU, and because I attended there,\n                                 I am a better individual. Thank you SJSU!”\n\n\n\nTara Caughlan\n’16 MA Environmental Studies\n“I met so many amazing students and staff at SJSU. In the environmental studies program,\n                                 I was surrounded by people who wanted to make the world a better place. I now work\n                                 at the San Francisco Zoo, which is dedicated to conservation, both local and distant.\n                                 My studies at SJSU helped me see the plight of animals in a much larger context. Thank\n                                 you, SJSU!”\n\n\n\nTommy Wen Chin\n’22 Physics\n“[My SJSU professor] gave me the courage that I had been longing for to pursue physics.\n                                 Every day since then, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to pursue what\n                                 I truly love.”\n\n\n\nLaurel Eby\n’10 MA Library and Information Science\n“I was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years when I decided to go back to school to get\n                                 a master's degree in library and information science. A year after I graduated I started\n                                 working at the King Library in February 2012, and just finished my ninth year there.\n                                 I love working in the MLK Library, and on the SJSU campus. San José State truly transformed\n                                 my life!”\n\n\n\nAlec Giurlani\nAcademic Advisor, H&A Student Success Center\n“As a student at SJSU, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. The entire College of\n                                 Humanities and the Arts was so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer\n                                 journey. I never expected SJSU to be such a kind and loving family. Thankfully, I\n                                 am now more than five years cancer-free and working full time at SJSU as an academic\n                                 advisor. I’m grateful for SJSU and the opportunity to give back.”\n\n\n\nCarl Henderson\n’04 African American Studies\n“My time at SJSU was a great transformation. As a transfer student from the U.S. Military\n                                 Academy at West Point, I arrived in San José deflated and depressed. I found positivity\n                                 and inspiration within the Xi Gamma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. After graduation\n                                 I pursued coaching...with the life mission of ‘encouraging students to have a dream\n                                 and admonishing them to have courage through adversity.’ My time at SJSU, though full\n                                 of trials and tribulations, was the greatest time of my life.”\n\n\n\nMarielle Lacanlale\n’22 Nursing\n“If I had not gone to SJSU to pursue nursing, I would not have been able to develop\n                                 the work ethic that I have now to achieve my goals. SJSU has also provided me with\n                                 a very strong Filipino community. I had also grown a very close knit friend group\n                                 that has been able to support me in my journey throughout college. Now that I am in\n                                 the nursing school here, SJSU has provided me with so many opportunities to make a\n                                 difference within my community.”\n\n\n\nAlexandra Salazar\n’20 Molecular Biology\n“Coming to SJSU introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help\n                                 transform me into the scientist I am becoming. Thanks to the resources and guidance\n                                 I received at SJSU, I will begin pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at the Scripps Research\n                                 Institute starting fall 2021.”\n\n\n\nNorman K. Tuitavuki\n’17 MA Transportation Management\n“I completed a graduate degree from San Jose Staté University several years ago. Without\n                                 this formal training, I don’t know where I’d be at this moment in my life. The education\n                                 I received from San Jose Staté has given me the tools I need to advance my career\n                                 upward.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\nSan José State University\n\nSJSU on Facebook\nSJSU on Twitter\nSJSU on LinkedIn\nSJSU on Instagram\nSJSU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Washington SquareSan José, CA 95192\n408-924-1000\nSJSU Online\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nAccreditation\nTitle IX\nDiversity\nLand Acknowledgement\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n\nColleges\n\nBusiness\nEducation\nEngineering\nGraduate Studies\nHealth and Human Sciences\nHumanities and the Arts\nInformation, Data and Society\nProfessional Education\nScience\nSocial Science\n\n\n\nResources\n\nA-Z Index\nAnnual Security Report [pdf]\nBookstore\nCalendars\nCareers and Jobs\nCatalog\nCurrent Students\nEmergency Food & Housing\nFaculty & Staff\nFreedom of Speech\nKing Library\nNewsCenter\nParenting Students\nParking and Maps\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nContact Form\nDirectory\nDoing Business with SJSU\nEmergency Info\nFile a Complaint\nReport a Title IX Complaint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Last Updated Apr 6, 2024\n\n"

In the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and College Pulse’s 2025 Best Colleges in the U.S. rankings, released Thursday, SJSU ranked as the #4 best public university in the nation and #16 overall. \nThe rankings, which rate the top 500 universities in the country, measure how well each college sets graduates up for financial success, how much a school improves students’ chances of graduating and their future earnings and balances these outcomes with feedback from students on college life. SJSU vaulted 157 spots from last year’s overall rankings. \n“San José State is a premier public university in the country, and we are thrilled this ranking highlights what many Spartans already know — SJSU prepares students to succeed as graduates and transform their lives,” said President Cynthia Teniente-Matson. “We are the anchor institution of the Epicenter of the Future here in Silicon Valley, and our tremendous students, faculty, staff, alumni and community deserve the credit for making this university a world-class institution.”\nIn additional rankings, SJSU ranked #5 among public universities, and #17 overall, for Best Salaries, which according to WSJ, “lists schools in order of their impact on graduates’ salaries and how this relates to the cost of attending the college.” The university also ranked #28 for social mobility and #42 for best value in the nation. \nSJSU is no stranger to strong rankings from WSJ. Last year, SJSU earned several top rankings among public universities for salaries for graduates:\n\n#1 in accounting\n#2 in marketing\n#4 in data science\n#5 in engineering\n#6 in software development\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nSJSU Named Fulbright HSI Leader by the U.S. Department of State for Fourth Year Running\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: Fifth Annual GIS Day Focuses on Democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSJSU Hosts Inaugural First-Gen Week Celebration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-Year Writing Program Presents the Inaugural Digital Literacy Expo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nShare this post:\nShare on X (Twitter)\nShare on Facebook\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages Stories\nFor the Media\nSubscribe\nAbout NewsCenter\n\nCategories Academics\nAthletics\nAwards and Achievements\nCampus Life\nCommunity Engagement\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nLeadership\nResearch and Innovation\nSpartan Spotlight\n\nSJSU Sites SJSU.edu \nAccessibility \nAccreditation \nTitle IX \nDiversity \nLand Acknowledgement \nPrivacy \nWashington Square: the Magazine \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This new college also represents a cross-campus strategy to expand access to degrees that crosscut  information and data sciences, and gives SJSU the capacity to enhance its role as a workforce development leader in the fields of information and library science, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics and ethics, instructional design, and cybersecurity at the undergraduate and graduate levels. SJSU is launching a search for a permanent dean for IDS this fall.\n“Putting these programs together into one college is yet another example of SJSU maximizing its resources and innovating to the benefit of our students,” said SJSU President Cynthia Teniente-Matson. “We are at a pivotal moment in the future of information. SJSU intends to lead our students into that future, ensuring they will be well-prepared to meet this moment.”\n\n\nVincent Del Casino, Jr. introduces the College of IDS.\nThe iSchool prepares students for careers as information professionals in diverse areas such as libraries and librarianship, user experience design, digital asset management, information architecture, electronic records management, information governance and digital preservation. \nThe Applied Data Science Department offers academic programs to address emerging workforce demands of interdisciplinary talents designing and deploying intelligent solutions to real-world data challenges. \nThe debut of IDS comes as SJSU prepares to host the annual Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) convening on campus November 7-8, 2024. PIT-UN is a collaboration among dozens of higher education institutions committed to building the field of public interest technology.\nVisit the College of Information, Data and Society website to learn more. \n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nSJSU Named Fulbright HSI Leader by the U.S. Department of State for Fourth Year Running\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: Fifth Annual GIS Day Focuses on Democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-Year Writing Program Presents the Inaugural Digital Literacy Expo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Yuen Explores Europa (From a Distance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nShare this post:\nShare on X (Twitter)\nShare on Facebook\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages Stories\nFor the Media\nSubscribe\nAbout NewsCenter\n\nCategories Academics\nAthletics\nAwards and Achievements\nCampus Life\nCommunity Engagement\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nLeadership\nResearch and Innovation\nSpartan Spotlight\n\nSJSU Sites SJSU.edu \nAccessibility \nAccreditation \nTitle IX \nDiversity \nLand Acknowledgement \nPrivacy \nWashington Square: the Magazine \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Photo by Jim Gensheimer.\n\n\nFirst-year writing students will present interactive projects at the inaugural Digital Literacy Expo.\nOn November 22, San José State’s First-Year Writing (FYW) Program is proud to present its first-ever Digital Literacy Expo, an interactive showcase of student work spotlighting digital works in progress. The event is part of an ongoing digital literacy initiative supported by Adobe Systems and the Office of the Provost at SJSU, as well as a California State University Supported Pathways grant to support instruction in first-year writing.\nAssociate Professor of Rhetoric and Writing Ryan Skinnell serves as the director of the First-Year Writing Project and is partnering with Amanda Smith, coordinator of the Stretch English program (a one-year program that divides English 1A into two semesters), to host the event. \n“We define digital literacy in terms of texts, broadly defined, that appear in digital spaces,” Skinnell says. “If I write a paper for class, how might that be put into different media? It could be available to people on a website or turned into a video or podcast.”\nParticipating students have the opportunity to present assignments created using a variety of Adobe tools. In addition to Skinnell and Smith’s students, five other first-year writing classes will contribute work for the expo. Assignments are fairly open-ended, depending on the class; Skinnell’s students are expected to produce an op-ed about voting rights, while another instructor’s class is creating work that examines environmental texts. The event will take place in rooms 4A/4B on the second floor of the Lupe and Compean Diaz Student Union, where the public is invited to circulate to speak with students about their projects on display.\nMia Castillo Garcia, ’28 Biological Sciences, plans to present a project dedicated to her family at the expo on Nov. 22.\n“In my English class, we were assigned to connect our favorite food with a memory [by creating] a web page,” she explains. “I immediately thought of lomo saltado (beef stir fry), my favorite Peruvian dish, which reminds me of an unforgettable and bittersweet memory of my mother teaching me how to make it while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.”\nCastillo Garcia adds that the assignment allowed her to share her story “not only with words, but also images of the dish, creating a richer and more meaningful experience.” The experience has also challenged her to experiment with various storytelling tools.\n“Learning to use AI-generated images and other digital tools has shown me the power of digital literacy, and I believe we should all embrace these tools to further our participation in today’s society,” she says. “I discovered a love for turning my writing into web pages and videos which I might never have explored otherwise. Everyone can find a unique way to share their stories; it’s just a matter of finding what fits you best.”\nEmphasizing the creative process\nRyan Skinnell participated in SJSU’s 2024 First-Year Writing Digital Literacy Symposium in August for writing teachers who want to learn to incorporate different modalities for composition into their teaching. Photo by Robert C. Bain.“The Digital Literacy Expo offers a different way to think about the curriculum,” says Skinnell. “We’re not replacing traditional essays by any stretch of the imagination, but we’re thinking about how students engage with writing and reading in their classes when they go to work out in the world.”\n\nStudents are experimenting with Adobe products and other digital tools that sometimes incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), which Skinnell hopes will prompt productive dialogue about how to appropriately incorporate AI into creative and academic writing.\n“We as writing teachers now have the opportunity to think about what we bring to the work of teaching writing if a polished text can be produced by robots,” he says. “AI can produce at the drop of a hat, but it can’t figure out how to work through feedback and incorporate things from class discussion over a series of iterations.”\nThose iterations make up the real act of writing and rewriting, he says, and offer students the chance to experiment with various forms of storytelling.\nSkinnell hopes that the inaugural Digital Literacy Expo helps all First-Year Writing students understand that there are many ways to present their work, with an emphasis on the drafting, revising and rewriting processes. \n“Our students are starting to think really early in their first-year writing classes about how they write and produce the knowledge that will carry them through their majors,” he says. “The things that students produce may surprise them. I’m very curious to see what they produce.”\nLearn more about the Digital Literacy Expo on Nov. 22.\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: Fifth Annual GIS Day Focuses on Democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Yuen Explores Europa (From a Distance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSJSU Native American Indigenous Student Success Center Welcomes the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley to Host the American Indigenous Heritage Celebration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: The Importance and Value of Accessible Education with SJSU Online Student Jade Steele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nShare this post:\nShare on X (Twitter)\nShare on Facebook\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages Stories\nFor the Media\nSubscribe\nAbout NewsCenter\n\nCategories Academics\nAthletics\nAwards and Achievements\nCampus Life\nCommunity Engagement\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nLeadership\nResearch and Innovation\nSpartan Spotlight\n\nSJSU Sites SJSU.edu \nAccessibility \nAccreditation \nTitle IX \nDiversity \nLand Acknowledgement \nPrivacy \nWashington Square: the Magazine \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Photo by Javier Duarte.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) recognizes select Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) as Fulbright HSI Leaders for their strong engagement with the Fulbright program. As of November 4, San José State is proud to be named a 2023-2024 Fulbright HSI Leader for the fourth consecutive year.\nSan José State is one of four California State Universities (CSUs) included in the list. The recognized colleges and universities include seven associate’s colleges, five baccalaureate colleges, two special focus institutions, 10 master’s colleges and universities, and 28 doctoral universities. \nThe initiative encourages administrators, faculty and students at HSIs to engage with Fulbright and highlights the strength of HSIs as destinations for international students and scholars. The U.S. Department of State has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), the goal of which is to increase the awareness of and participation by the Hispanic community of the United States in the Fulbright Program and in other exchange programs supported by the U.S. Department of State.\n“I am confident that our engagement with the program will continue to grow as we advance our shared priority of teaching our talented and diverse students – the world’s future leaders – to become active and engaged participants in our increasingly interconnected, interdependent global economy and society,” said CSU Chancellor Mildred García, a two-time Fulbrighter herself. “My Fulbright experiences have enriched my personal and professional lives in immeasurable ways.”\nHSI students and faculty who have taken part in Fulbright opportunities come back to their campuses with new insights, and leaders of HACU-member institutions appreciate the long-term research partnerships and international collaborations made possible through Fulbright.\nScott Weinhold, Senior Bureau Official for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, commended the 2024 Fulbright HSI Leaders for their support of the Fulbright Program. Weinhold said, “Fulbrighters from HSIs contribute to the Program’s goal of reflecting the full diversity, perspectives, and talents of the American people.” \nAbout the Fulbright Program\nThe Fulbright Program is the U.S. government’s flagship international academic exchange program with a longstanding commitment to diversity, working to ensure that participants reflect the United States and societies abroad. The Fulbright Program works closely with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) to promote international exchange opportunities to staff, students and faculty at HSIs.  This year’s Fulbright HSI Leaders were announced at the HACU Annual Conference. Fulbright also works with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the National Clearinghouse on Disability and Exchange, the American Association of Community Colleges, Diversity Abroad and many more organizations.\nSince 1946, the Fulbright Program has provided more than 400,000 students, scholars, artists and teachers from all types of institutions the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research abroad. Fulbrighters build connections, gain experience, exchange ideas and address global challenges.\nFulbright is a program of the U.S. Department of State, with funding provided by the U.S. government. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the program.\nLearn about Fulbright’s efforts to further DEIA within the program and about the Fulbright HSI Leaders initiative.\n \n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-Year Writing Program Presents the Inaugural Digital Literacy Expo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Yuen Explores Europa (From a Distance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: The Importance and Value of Accessible Education with SJSU Online Student Jade Steele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSJSU to Host Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) 2024 Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nShare this post:\nShare on X (Twitter)\nShare on Facebook\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages Stories\nFor the Media\nSubscribe\nAbout NewsCenter\n\nCategories Academics\nAthletics\nAwards and Achievements\nCampus Life\nCommunity Engagement\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nLeadership\nResearch and Innovation\nSpartan Spotlight\n\nSJSU Sites SJSU.edu \nAccessibility \nAccreditation \nTitle IX \nDiversity \nLand Acknowledgement \nPrivacy \nWashington Square: the Magazine \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her Energy Materials Lab will “contribute to the understanding of the interface between aqueous electrolytes and electrodes” for the Aqueous Battery Consortium. Photo by Robert C. Bain.\n\nSan José State recently joined the Aqueous Battery Consortium, an energy hub research project supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) and led by Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The project aims to find a reliable, sustainable way to store electricity, partially by creating a rechargeable battery made mostly of water (the “aqueous” part of the consortium) and other abundant materials. \nThe project may receive up to $62.5 million over five years as part of the DOE’s Energy Innovation Hubs program. \nCurrent aqueous batteries, including lead-acid batteries, don’t hold much energy, and  the lead they contain is harmful. Lithium-ion batteries, another current option, aren’t cost-effective. This new consortium aims to make the new batteries more environmentally safe, much cheaper to produce and more efficient.\nThe team consists of 31 leading battery scientists, engineers and physicists from 12 universities in North America, as well as from SLAC, the U.S. Army Research Lab and the U.S. Naval Research Lab.\nSan José State’s contribution to the project comes through Dahyun Oh, associate professor of materials engineering. She is on two of the nine teams that structure the project: the interface team and the team on materials design and synthesis.\nShe adds, “My lab, the Energy Materials Laboratory, will contribute to the understanding of the interface between aqueous electrolytes and electrodes. In batteries, interfaces play a crucial role in enabling battery reactions, and the interfacial behavior with aqueous electrolytes is less understood compared to organic electrolyte systems.”\nHer team feels “grateful and fortunate” to be included in this effort, which she believes will help people “recognize the potential of SJSU, its faculty and its students.”   \n“This is an absolutely groundbreaking opportunity for my career, as well as for the SJSU students who will join this project,” she says. “Collaborative research is especially important for students at minority-serving institutions (MSI), as they have fewer opportunities to engage with graduate or postgraduate-level researchers. This consortium will provide a golden opportunity for students to learn, engage, develop research skills and build networks.”\nAfter all, a next-generation, environmentally-friendly battery could help power the world, and SJSU will be an integral part of this effort. As Oh concludes, “We have numerous opportunities to offer, and our national recognition continues to grow.” \nLearn more about the Aqueous Battery Consortium.\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: Fifth Annual GIS Day Focuses on Democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-Year Writing Program Presents the Inaugural Digital Literacy Expo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Yuen Explores Europa (From a Distance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Dive in Five: The Importance and Value of Accessible Education with SJSU Online Student Jade Steele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nShare this post:\nShare on X (Twitter)\nShare on Facebook\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Reddit\nShare on Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages Stories\nFor the Media\nSubscribe\nAbout NewsCenter\n\nCategories Academics\nAthletics\nAwards and Achievements\nCampus Life\nCommunity Engagement\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nLeadership\nResearch and Innovation\nSpartan Spotlight\n\nSJSU Sites SJSU.edu \nAccessibility \nAccreditation \nTitle IX \nDiversity \nLand Acknowledgement \nPrivacy \nWashington Square: the Magazine \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Be yourself.  \nCABARET has music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb and a book by Joe Masteroff – based on the play by John Van Druten and stories by Christopher Isherwood.\nDirected by Janie Scott\nPerformance dates are: Nov 15, 16, 21, 22, 23  at 7:30pm; Nov 20th at 11am (Student Matinee), and Sunday Matinee Nov 24  at 2pm\n \n$10 Student Tickets\n$20 Adult Tickets\n$30 Onstage Cabaret Seating (Tickets under \"General Seating\")\nAs part of the Transforming Communities grant, we're delighted to offer free tickets to current SJSU students to attend the November 15th performance of Cabaret.

But what is a Spartan at SJSU? A soldier, an athlete, a scholar, a professor? On our campus, a Spartan can be an engineer, an educator, an artist, a philosopher, a scientist — an advocate for justice and equality.In my eight years interviewing SJSU students, alumni, faculty, staff and community members, I’ve observed that Spartans share a common value: A strong desire to create a better world.Some lay the foundation on the mat in the dojo, à la Yoshihiro Uchida, ’47 Biological Sciences, ’04 Honorary Doctorate, who dedicated more than 75 years to training Olympic-caliber judokas. Others establish spaces like the Kogura Gifts store in San José’s historic Japantown, surviving and thriving beyond World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. No mention of San José State athletics history would be complete without the late Lawrence Fan, proverbial torchbearer for generations of student-athletes, coaches and sports media professionals.Some Spartans make their mark in the arts and sciences. Pioneering Professor Emerita of Music Charlene Archibeque paved the way for singers, performing artists and music educators. Librarian Mychal Threets, ’18 MLIS, has expanded the definition of “library joy” by creating inclusive spaces in the public library and online. As for the future: the sky’s the limit for Spartan entrepreneurs seeking innovative solutions in every field.While we shed light on tremendous Spartan achievements, we also recognize how common it is to encounter impostor syndrome — the perception that we don’t belong. It is hard to learn, teach and achieve when faced with institutionalized and systemic obstacles. And yet, our students, faculty, alumni and staff prove day in and day out that San José State is a place for “firsts:” first public university on the West Coast, first city-university library, first-generation students.There’s no way to squeeze a century’s worth of Spartans into 32 pages, which is why we invite you to contribute to the San José State story. Tell us about the spaces you found at SJSU — or the places you’ve created since. Show us what being a Spartan means to you.Share your Spartan storyNone of this storytelling is possible without my fellow writers — Cassie Myers, Michelle Smith McDonald, Lesley Seacrist, Amy Villa; our trusty art director and designer Pourya Nadimi; our amazing creative director Michelle Frey; our fantastic illustrator Sierra Ferrato; expert photographers Jim Gensheimer and Robert C.

agency serving higher education institutions throughout the U.S.\n                                 and around the world, with most institutions historically in California, Hawaii, and\n                                 the Pacific region.\nThe Commission serves to ensure success for all students by assisting institutions\n                                 in developing and sustaining effective educational programs and assuring the educational\n                                 community, parents, students, employers and the public that the institution meets\n                                 the high standards of quality and effectiveness.  \nAccreditation is also necessary for participation in Title IV federal funding and\n                                 state financial aid programs.\nThe WSCUC Institutional Directory provides additional information related to SJSU's accreditation.\n\n\n\n\nProgrammatic (Specialized) Accreditation\nSeveral SJSU programs are accredited by professional specialized accreditation organizations.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nThe Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics team provides accurate, reliable and timely data, information, and research to support\n                                    SJSU data-informed decision-making and compliance with state, federal, district, and\n                                    college requirements.\n\n \n\nFor SJSU Faculty and Staff: The Institutional Effectiveness Resources site provides additional information and resources related to accreditation, assessment,\n

A report could come from\n                                    the person who experienced the harm, a concerned community member, or a Responsible\n                                    Employee. A complaint is an official request for an investigation and may only be\n                                    made by the person who experienced the harm, or the university.

The President’s Leadership team on Equity and Justice\n                                    is facilitating and coordinating the university’s initiatives on racial equity and\n                                    justice. This leadership team is charged with understanding the initiatives being\n                                    generated on campus and the tracking of the follow-through in achieving the goals\n                                    of those initiatives. Learn about SJSU’s immediate steps—as well as intermediate and\n                                    long-term plans—to create permanent organizational change with regard to systemic\n                                    racism on our campus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias\nAnti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of bias have\n                                    always been with us. The current pandemic has seen an exponential rise in anti-Asian\n                                    discrimination and milder microaggressions. We recognize the horrific disparities\n                                    in higher morbidity and infection rates for Black/African Americans, Native Americans,\n                                    and Latinx peoples from COVID-19 across the country. These collective realities have\n                                    a great impact on the climate, organizational identity, and retention of employees.\n                                    \n                                    Crafted within the complex cultural and political contexts of the Bay Area, this webinar\n                                    will (1) introduce historical and social psychological frameworks for organizational\n                                    leaders and team members to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 xenophobia and bias,\n                                    and (2) offer research-informed interventions and strategies to address anti-Asian\n                                    bias incidents when they occur in the context of crisis.

Some of\n                  the enrolled Muwekma lineages are descended from direct ancestors from the Thámien\n                  Ohlone tribal territory whose ancestors had affiliation with Mission Santa Clara.\nThe San José State University community also recognizes the importance of this land\n                  to the indigenous Muwekma Ohlone people of this region, and consistent with our principles\n                  of community and diversity strives to be good stewards on behalf of the Muwekma Ohlone\n                  Tribe whose land we occupy.\n\nThe portion of this video above (beginning at 6:25) provides important context for\n                  the Land Acknowledgement that was generously given to SJSU by the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe\n                  for SJSU use.  Tribe Chairwoman Charlene Nijmeh gives a powerful detailed accounting\n                  of the specific steps and history of the disenfranchisement of the Muwekma Ohlone\n                  peoples, as well as the strength and presence of their community today. Tribe Vice\n                  Chairwoman Monica V. Arellano gives a detailed context to understand our presence\n                  on the ancestral lands of the Muwekma Ohlone, land on which our institution and the\n                  city of San Jose occupy.  Their leadership reminds us of how much further we have\n                  to go, and that this Land Acknowledgement is a very small step towards further action.\nWe are grateful for Charlene Nijmeh and Monica V. Arellano of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribal Council for providing SJSU with a Land Acknowledgement and Greeting.\nWe encourage you to use the Land Acknowledgment in its entirety out of respect for\n                  the process and words given us by the Muwekma Ohlone.\nDownload a PDF version of this Land Acknowledgment\nLink to shareable Google Slides document with this Land Acknowledgment specifically for SJSU events and meetings \nDownload a PDF of the Muwekma Ohlone greeting to Learn More about the Tribe and its History\nPronounciation Guide for this Land Acknowledgment\nWhat is a Land Acknowledgment?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity @ SJSU\nCampus Committee on DEI\nCCDEI Action Plan Framework 2023\nCommittee\n\n\nInclusive Excellence Framework\nSJSU: By the Numbers\nbelong@SJSU Campus Climate\nArchive\n2014 Commission on Diversity\nCommission Roster\nMinutes & Agendas\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\n\nLand Acknowledgement\nPronunciation Guide\nWhat is a Land Acknowledgment?\n\n\nCombating Systemic Racism\nNational Day of Racial Healing 1/16/2024\nActions on Systemic Racism\nTransforming Communities\nInitiatives, Activities and Programs\nMessages From President Papazian\nResources\nReadings and Informational Resources\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nConnect with ODEI\nEducation\nDEI Terms\nDiversity Training and Consulting\nInterGroup Dialogue Program\nFall 2024 Dialogues on Israel-Palestine\nIGD Institute\nIGD Spring 2024\nInterGroup Dialogue Program\n\n\nUROP\n\n\nODEI Communications\nCelebrate Juneteenth 2024!\n5 May 2024 Bias Incident in Joe West Residence Hall\n27 February 2024 Spring Religious Holidays\nPromoting Healthy Dialogue About Israel/Hamas War\n10 October 2023 Violence in the Middle East\nFall 2023 Religious Holidays\nSupreme Court Decisions\n\n\nODEI Events\nODEI Events Archive\nHealing Space January 26, 2023\nPromoting Healthy Dialogue About Israel/Hamas Violence\nRemembrance Day May 11, 2022\nSJSU Legacy Run 10/30/21\n\n\nSJSU Legacy Run\n\n\nODEI Institutes\nODEI Institutes Archive\nAntiracist Action Summer Institute 2021\nAntiracism Reprogramming in Health Professions Education\n\n\n\n\nODEI Newsletter\nODEI Staff\nKristin Nicole Dukes, Ph.D. Chief Diversity Officer\nFelicia McKee-Fegans, Executive Assistant and Diversity Program Specialist\nJahmal Williams, Director of Advocacy for Racial Justice\ncraig John Alimo, Ph.D., Director for Social Justice Education\nODEI Alum\nDawn Lee, Ph.D. Interim Chief Diversity Officer\nFernanda Perdomo-Arciniegas, MPA, Deputy Diversity Officer\nKathleen Wong(Lau), Ph.D., Chief Diversity Officer\nPatience D.

The University will not distribute or\n                     share electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d)\n                     of California Government Code Section 11015.5) about users to any third party without\n                     the permission of the user, except in narrow circumstances set forth in this Notice.\n                     The University will not sell any electronically collected personal information to\n                     any third party. Such electronically-collected personal information is exempt from\n                     requests made pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing\n                     with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1).\nHow we use the information we collect\nWe use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including\n                     any personal information:\n\nTo provide you with information that you request from us.\nTo process application, registration and enrollment requests when you apply, register\n                        or enroll for our campuses, events, programs or services, or otherwise administer\n                        your participation in our events, programs or services, including (without limitation)\n                        study abroad and distance learning, financial aid, housing and dining.\nTo collect and process donations, gifts and donor information.\nTo process service requests from students, staff, faculty, and other members of the\n                        campus community, including the facilitation of parking permit and identification\n                        card requests.\nTo process registration for sports, cultural, educational, and other university events.\nTo respond to your questions, requests, comments or complaints and determine your\n                        satisfaction with our events, programs and services.\nTo operate, maintain, and provide to you the features, services, and functionality\n                        of the Sites and its contents, and to monitor and improve our site and the user experience.\nTo provide information about our University and send you related information including\n                        brochures and other University materials, campus and CSU news, academic notices, updates,\n                        security alerts, special offers, confirmations, and support and administrative messages.\nTo notify you about changes to our Sites or any services we offer or provide through\n                        it.\nTo compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and accuracy.\nTo prevent, detect or investigate any fraudulent, abusive or illegal act.\nTo allow you to participate in interactive features on our Sites.\nIn any other way we may describe when you provide the information.\nFor any other purpose with your consent.\n\nWe may also use your personal information for operational and other lawful purposes\n                     such as security, analytics, operations, fraud detection and prevention, reporting,\n                     making back-ups and legal compliance.\nWe use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information\n                     so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit\n                     the Sites; (b) monitor the effectiveness of our Sites and services; (c) monitor aggregate\n                     metrics such as the total number of visitors and traffic; (d) diagnose or fix technology\n                     problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses\n                     controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (e) help you efficiently access information.\nAt the time we collect personal information, we strive to tell users about the purpose\n                     for which the information is collected as well as the general or specific uses that\n                     we will make of that information.\nInternational transfer of personal information\nPersonal information provided to us by users outside of the United States may be transferred\n                     to other countries such as the United States, where data protection laws may differ\n                     from those of your home country. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge\n                     that your personal information may be transferred to the United States and processed\n                     on servers within the United States. However, all reasonable steps will be taken to\n                     protect your privacy in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\nUser Content\nAny personal information or content you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Sites\n                     (for instance, any content you post) (\"User Content\") becomes available to the public via the Sites. User Content includes, but is not\n                     limited to, comments, photos, videos, etc. If you remove User Content, copies may\n                     remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored\n                     your User Content.\nWe reserve the right to monitor the User Content you post on the Sites and to remove\n                     any User Content for any reason or no reason including, without limitation, if in\n                     our sole opinion, such material violates, or may violate, any applicable law, or to\n                     protect or defend our rights or those of any third party. We also reserve the right\n                     to remove User Content upon the request of any third party.\nCookie Policy\nCookies Information\nWhen you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing\n                     a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your\n                     browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the\n                     Sites. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session\n                     cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after\n                     you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent\n                     visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's\n                     directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.\n                     You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie\n                     is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly\n                     if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.\nGoogle Analytics\nWe use a tool called \"Google Analytics,\" a web analytics service provided by Google,\n                     Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. We use Advertising Features within\n                     Google Analytics, including Google Signals, remarketing with Google Analytics, Google\n                     Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Search Console. Google Analytics\n                     collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited,\n                     demographics and interests reporting, and what other sites were visited prior to coming\n                     to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve\n                     the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date\n                     you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google\n                     Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type of web browser, type\n                     of operating system, browser resolution, and network location, however we do not combine\n                     the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable\n                     information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser\n                     to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the cookie cannot\n                     be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected\n                     by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites\n                     by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you\n                     may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites. You may also opt-out of\n                     the Google Analytics Advertising Features through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile\n                     apps, or any other available means, such as the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.\nLog File Information\nLog file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access\n                     a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record\n                     certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These\n                     server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses\n                     or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating\n                     system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs,\n                     domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.\nClear Gifs Information\nWhen you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which\n                     are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal\n                     information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear\n                     gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.\nCalifornia Do Not Track Disclosures\nCalifornia Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January\n                     1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator\n                     responds to \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some\n                     browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing\n                     is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.\n                     We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users'\n                     online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses\n                     our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.\n \nHow we share your information\nWe share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes\n                     listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process\n                     your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors\n                     who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid\n                     or payment processing, education management, and web hosting). The University may\n                     also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators\n                     (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement\n                     applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue\n                     available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal\n                     information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other\n                     University policies and applicable laws and regulations. We will not distribute or\n                     share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision\n                     (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party\n                     without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving\n                     possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including\n                     but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency\n                     or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network\n                     operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.\nWe fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our\n                     Sites or services for illegal activities. We may report to law enforcement agencies\n                     any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal\n                     information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity,\n                     including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or\n                     litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law\n                     or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant\n                     permission to us in accordance with this Notice.\nHow we protect your information\nWe take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the\n                     integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access,\n                     and illegal use or disclosure. Such personal information is stored by the University\n                     in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management\n                     of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access\n                     to personal information is limited to those members of the University's staff whose\n                     work requires such access. Confidential information is destroyed according to the\n                     University's records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews\n                     to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood\n                     and followed.\nThe security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember\n                     that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is\n                     100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your\n                     personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information\n                     you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission\n                     of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of\n                     our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information\n                     may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,\n                     technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information\n                     and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.\nWe encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers\n                     and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy\n                     and security, please see the University's policies and procedures related to Information Security [pdf]; you may also consult with the California Attorney General's Privacy Enforcement and Protection website.\nIn the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security,\n                     we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has\n                     been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU\n                     Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nLinks to Other Websites\nWe are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our\n                     Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either\n                     express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy,\n                     completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor\n                     do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright,\n                     trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such\n                     site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination. We may provide links\n                     to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites\n                     does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites. Please\n                     remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, our Notice\n                     is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including\n                     those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.\n                     Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the\n                     security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU,\n                     nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless\n                     we specifically state so. We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third\n                     party site at any time.\nAccess and choice\nWe comply with all applicable regulations regarding data retention and deletion of\n                     personal data and retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill\n                     the purpose for which it was collected (including for college operations), for strategic\n                     planning, and to comply with applicable laws and retention requirements. You can ask\n                     to review, update or make changes to the personal information we maintain about you,\n                     or exercise your option of having your personal information discarded without reuse\n                     or distribution, by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out\n                     below. We may take a reasonable period of time to respond. If you request the deactivation\n                     or change of information on our system, such information may be retained in our backup\n                     systems for a period of time subject to technology restrictions, or as a precaution\n                     against systems failures. Some information may be retained for longer periods as required\n                     by law, contract or auditing requirements or as otherwise described in this Notice.\nYou have the option to decline providing information about yourself online and may\n                     use other methods, such as U.S. mail, to respond to requests for information or to\n                     communicate with us. You may use the contact information listed below to ask about\n                     additional alternatives to providing or obtaining information through use of our Sites.\nBy providing us your email address, you consent to our use of your email address to\n                     send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law,\n                     in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send\n                     you other messages, including, but not limited to, newsletters, information on campus\n                     activities, programs and events, legal updates, changes to features of our Sites or\n                     services, or other account information. Where required by law, we will obtain your\n                     consent before sending you specific types of email or other communications.\nYou can choose not to receive such emails from us by \"unsubscribing\" using the instructions\n                     in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or\n                     email address set out below. It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to\n                     process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account\n                     or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. Opting out does\n                     not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our\n                     use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.\nEEA Data Subject Rights\nIf you are an individual located in the EEA only, you have certain rights with regard\n                     to your personal data collected while you are in the EEA. These rights may include\n                     right of access, right of correction, right to be forgotten, right to restrict processing\n                     of your identifiable personal information, right to notice related to changes/deletion/processing\n                     limits, right to data portability, right to objection, right not to be subject to\n                     decisions based solely on automated processing, and right to withdraw consent. Some\n                     of these rights are restricted by law to information that was collected on the basis\n                     of explicit consent, or are restricted by other conditions (such as necessity for\n                     contract or to comply with the law). You have the right to contact us in connection\n                     with the exercise of your rights under applicable EEA law, which you can do through\n                     the contact information below, or by sending an email to privacy@calstate.edu.

We provide resources\n                  and services for SJSU students facing unexpected financial crises. If you’re having\n                  trouble paying for food, housing or other bills, come to us to get the help you need.\nRequest assistance now and we'll contact you to discuss next steps, eligibility, and possible campus and\n                  community resources.\nRequest Assistance Now\nFood Assistance\nAre you finding yourself struggling to afford food while attending SJSU? You are not\n                  alone. The most recent Student Affairs survey found that approximately half of SJSU\n                  students are sometimes skipping meals due to cost.\nThe good news is SJSU Cares has two great programs to help: \n\nSpartan Food Pantry\nCalFresh Application Assistance\n\nThese programs can help you get the food you need to focus on your education. Additionally,\n                  there are many other food resources available on campus and in the surrounding community.\n\nHousing Assistance\nAs a student, you may find yourself unexpectedly homeless if you lack stable, regular\n                  and adequate housing. You may be homeless if you are living in shelters, parks, motels\n                  or cars, or temporarily couch-surfing with other people because you have nowhere else\n                  to go. \nIf you are living in any of these situations because you are fleeing an abusive parent\n                  or guardian, you may be considered homeless even if they would provide support and\n                  a place to live. Or you may have an unexpected eviction, fire or other disaster where\n                  you are living. \nHousing insecurity is a real issue in Silicon Valley. Please contact SJSU Cares if you are in an emergency situation!\n\nMedical Assistance\nSkipping an urgent medical or dental appointment because a lack of resources or insurance\n                  can lead to an unhealthy situation. Unexpected medical bills can seriously impact\n                  a student's monthly budget.\nContact SJSU Cares to find out what resources are available to help you pay for medical bills or insurance.\n                  We want to help you stay healthy!\n\nEmergency/Disaster Assistance\nStudents share with us when they may have been a victim of a crime such as theft or\n                  burglary, or of a natural disaster like fire or flood, which has negatively affected\n                  their ability to succeed on campus.\nIf you are facing any kind of emergency situation, contact SJSU Cares to find support and resources.\n\nClothing Assistance\nThe Career Closet, operated by the Career Center, has a focus on providing students with free professional\n                  clothing and up to one full professional outfit per academic year.  This can assist\n                  with interviews, job fairs, etc.  Visit thier website to make an appointment. \n\nParenting Students Assistance\nCalifornia Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)\nThe California Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) promotes the health of low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding people,\n                  infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing nutritious\n                  food to supplement diets, information on healthy eating including breastfeeding promotion\n                  and support, and referrals to health care. You may qualify if you receive Medi-Cal,\n                  CalWORKs (TANF) or CalFresh (SNAP) benefits. WIC welcomes military families, migrant\n                  families, fathers, foster parents and legal guardians with eligible children. Participating\n                  in the WIC program does not affect the immigration status of anyone currently in the\n                  U.S. Use the WIC eligibility assessment tool to see if you qualify. Set up an appointment at a WIC local agency near you. Visit\n                  the website for WIC families to find a WIC local agency site near you.\nDiapers\nMultiple community based agencies indicate that they have assistance with diapers\n                  through their programs. Knowing that our students live in many communities it is best\n                  to search for diaper assistance by your location.\n \nPersonal Hygiene Products\nThe Spartan Food Pantry offers menstrual hygiene products for its users. See the pantry website for eligibility.\nFor general locations of free sanitary products on campus visit the Gender Equity Center Sanitary Products page.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nGet Assistance \nCase Management\nSpartan Food Pantry\nCalFresh Food\nHousing Assistance\n\n\nResources \nFinancial Literacy: iGrad\nParenting Students\n\n\nGive Assistance \nPantry Donation Guide\n\n\nAbout\nWhat We Do \nContact Us\nData and Reports\nRequest a Presentation\nFAQ\nMeet Our Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSJSU Cares\n\nPLACEHOLDER-FOR-XSL:VALUE-OF(SITE-TITLE) on Facebook\nPLACEHOLDER-FOR-XSL:VALUE-OF(SITE-TITLE) on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nPhone: 408.924.1234 Email: sjsucares@sjsu.edu\nTranslate\nPlease note, services are offered primarily in English.\n\n\n\nVisit Office\n\nSJSU Cares\nClark Hall – Room 140\nMonday - Friday 9 am - 5 pm \nClosed 12 pm - 1 pm\nSpartan Food PantryDiaz Compean Student Union (exterior entrance across from Engineering Rotunda)\nPantry HoursPlease visit the pantry page for updated hours.\n\n\n\nMake a Gift\n\nGive to SJSU Cares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\nSan José State University\n\nSJSU on Facebook\nSJSU on Twitter\nSJSU on LinkedIn\nSJSU on Instagram\nSJSU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Washington SquareSan José, CA 95192\n408-924-1000\nSJSU Online\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nAccreditation\nTitle IX\nDiversity\nLand Acknowledgement\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n\nColleges\n\nBusiness\nEducation\nEngineering\nGraduate Studies\nHealth and Human Sciences\nHumanities and the Arts\nInformation, Data and Society\nProfessional Education\nScience\nSocial Science\n\n\n\nResources\n\nA-Z Index\nAnnual Security Report [pdf]\nBookstore\nCalendars\nCareers and Jobs\nCatalog\nCurrent Students\nEmergency Food & Housing\nFaculty & Staff\nFreedom of Speech\nKing Library\nNewsCenter\nParenting Students\nParking and Maps\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nContact Form\nDirectory\nDoing Business with SJSU\nEmergency Info\nFile a Complaint\nReport a Title IX Complaint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Last Updated Oct 7, 2024\n\n"

Universities like SJSU\n                                    have a special obligation to encourage and support the free expression of ideas, values,\n                                    and opinions, even when they may be unpopular or controversial. The university shall\n                                    ensure that individuals and groups are afforded wide latitude in exercising the right\n                                    of free expression and that their constitutionally protected right to free expression\n                                    is protected while on campus. Freedom of expression, however, is not an absolute right\n                                    and it coexists with other rights and the need for public safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           \t\t\t\tLoading video content...\n                           \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSU Interim Free Expression and Time, Place, and Manner Policy\nThe California State University systemwide Interim Free Expression and Time, Place\n                                 and Manner policy provides regulations to ensure that those who participate in lawful\n                                 expressive activities are protected and do not disrupt university operations or infringe\n                                 on the rights of others. SJSU has produced an additional addendum specific to the\n                                 main campus and affiliated locations.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Freedom of Speech?\nLearn how the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and how this right is protected\n                                 here at SJSU.\n\n\n\n\nIs There Any Speech Prohibited by the First Amendment?\nThe First Amendment does not prohibit any speech, but there are some types of speech\n                                 for which there is no, or very limited, First Amendment protection.\n\n\n\n\nRecognized Student Organizations\nSJSU has more than 350 Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs) spanning a wide array\n                                 of topics, interests and viewpoints. RSOs are free to invite speakers to campus and\n                                 provide access to campus venues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection Activities and Other Advocacy\nSJSU encourages our Spartan community to be civically engaged and make their voices\n                                    heard on the issues they care about.
